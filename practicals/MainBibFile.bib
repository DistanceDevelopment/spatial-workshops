  abstract = {Detection distance is an important and common auxiliary variable measured
	during avian point count surveys. Distance data are used to determine
	the area sampled and to model the detection process using distance
	sampling theory. In densely forested habitats, visual detections
	of birds are rare, and most estimates of detection distance are based
	on auditory cues. Distance sampling theory assumes detection distances
	are measured accurately, but empirical validation of this assumption
	for auditory detections is lacking. We used a song playback system
	to simulate avian point counts with known distances in a forested
	habitat to determine the error structure of distance estimates based
	on auditory detections. We conducted field evaluations with 6 experienced
	observers both before and after distance estimation training. We
	conducted additional studies to determine the effect of height and
	speaker orientation (toward or away from observers) on distance estimation
	error. Distance estimation errors for all evaluations were substantial,
	although training reduced errors and bias in distance estimates by
	approximately 15%. Measurement errors showed a nonlinear relationship
	to distance. Our results suggest observers were not able to differentiate
	distances beyond 65 m. The height from which we played songs had
	no effect on distance estimation errors in this habitat. The orientation
	of the song source did have a large effect on distance estimation
	errors; observers generally doubled their distance estimates for
	songs played away from them compared with distance estimates for
	songs played directly toward them. These findings, which we based
	on realistic field conditions, suggest measures of uncertainty in
	distance estimates to auditory detections are substantially higher
	than assumed by most researchers. This means aural point count estimates
	of avian abundance based on distance methods deserve careful scrutiny
	because they are likely biased.},

  abstract = {In the Southern Hemisphere, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)
	were heavily exploited from both coastal stations and in pelagic
	waters in all major ocean basins. About 200,000 whales were taken
	after 1900, causing declines of populations to small percentages
	of their pre-exploitation levels. The study presented here aimed
	to investigate humpback whale abundance in the Brazilian coastal
	breeding ground, in order to provide information to support further
	analysis of the population recovery. Between 25 August and 2 September
	2001, a fixed wing, flat window, aircraft was used to survey transect
	lines along the northern limit of Bahia State (12°10’S), to the southern
	limit of Espírito Santo State (20°42’S). All on-effort sightings
	were recorded and abundance was estimated according to standard distance
	sampling methodology (Burnham et al., 1980; Buckland et al., 1993).
	Group sizes of humpback whales ranged between 1-5 and the mean group
	size was 1.52 (±0.06). The model that best fitted the perpendicular
	distance data, based on the minimum Akaike Information Criterion,
	was the hazard rate model. The population size estimated using uncorrected
	data was 1,493 (CV=0.21) whales. Surface time was used to correct
	the estimates for gˆ (0), resulting in a correction factor of 0.67
	(±0.15). The corrected analysis for each block and combined result,
	increased the population size estimate to 2,229 (CV=0.31) individuals.
	The data from this study could be used to identify new areas appropriate
	for whalewatching, to monitor the status and dynamics of the humpback
	whale population off the Brazilian coast and to provide information
	for the establishment of new protected areas},

  abstract = {The Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi is endemic to the Caribbean island
	of Montserrat where, prior to 1995, it was widely distributed across
	the island's three main interior mountain ranges: the Centre, Soufriere
	and South Soufriere Hills. In July 1995, a long-dormant volcano on
	Chances Peak in the Soufriere Hills began to erupt. Since then the
	forest habitat of the oriole on the Soufriere and South Soufriere
	Hills has been devastated by pyroclastic flows and surges, heavy
	ash eruptions and rock falls. The Montserrat Oriole populations that
	inhabited these two mountain ranges have probably been lost. In December
	1997, a census of the remaining Centre Hills population was undertaken
	to assess its status in the face of the heavy ash fall that occurred
	earlier the same year. To do this, a systematic grid of 140 sample
	points was overlaid on an area of 1,437·5 ha encompassing the Centre
	Hills, and a 10-minute count of all bird species was undertaken at
	137 of these points during an eight-day survey period. The distance
	from the point to each oriole detected was measured and records of
	all other species were allocated to one of five distance bands radiating
	out from the point. Distance sampling was used to model densities,
	and thus to estimate population sizes, of eight bird species in the
	study area. It was estimated that 4,000 (95% CIs 1,500-7,800) Montserrat
	Orioles remain in the Centre Hills and thus the world. Although the
	probability of pyroclastic flows and surges overrunning the Centre
	Hills is considered remote, it is recommended that the Montserrat
	Oriole be classified as Globally Threatened (Endangered) under the
	revised IUCN threat categories because of its loss of breeding habitat
	since 1995.},

  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;A major target for environmental managers when
	trying to minimise the road-barrier effect on wildlife is to improve
	permeability to animal movements. Previous studies have demonstrated
	that drainage culverts are used by vertebrates, although knowledge
	of the main influencing factors remains limited. The use of 34 culverts
	from two roads in southern Portugal, differing in traffic volume,
	vehicle speeds and configuration, was evaluated by the analysis of
	terrestrial vertebrate footprint data (408 passage-operative days).
	Culvert crossings were related to various explanatory variables by
	means of canonical ordination techniques. We recorded 901 complete
	crossings, corresponding to an average of 2.2 crossings/culvert/operative
	day. Thirteen taxa were detected, all in more than one passage. Animal
	species included reptiles, small mammals, lagomorphs, carnivores
	and domestic dogs and cats. Our results suggest that fencing might
	have a funnelling effect, directing larger animals toward culverts.
	Also, vegetation covering culvert entrances seems to have a positive
	effect, particularly on genets; longer passages with entrances far
	from the pavement were, apparently, avoided by smaller animals; a
	lower number of crossings was detected on passages with detritus
	pits; the closest passages to urban areas are more often used by
	domestic species; forest-living species favour passages with low,
	open land cover nearby; and smaller species, like lagomorphs and
	small mammals, appear to use more culverts near the pavement, which
	probably reflects the importance of road verges as refuges for these
	species. Although not used by all species present in the study area,
	constructing numerous passages of different sizes without detritus
	pits and which are distributed along roads might be an important
	step in mitigating road fragmentation effects on animal populations.},

	exclude intermountain valleys, where tortoises are generally thought
	to be absent. Furthermore, few regional-level surveys have been conducted
	because of difficulties in sampling in the complex landscape of Sonoran
	Desert upland habitat. We used distance-sampling to document macrohabitat
	use and regional density of Desert Tortoises across the 76,800-ha
	Ironwood Forest National Monument in Arizona. We observed 42 tortoises
	on transects, and distance sampling produced an estimate of 17,997
	tortoises ? 150 mm carapace length (coefficient of variation = 41.5%)
	on the monument. Stratification by habitat type (steep topography
	with boulders, incised washes, or neither of these components) improved
	precision slightly (37.2%). Detection probability contributed least
	to density variance, compared to encounter rate and tortoise detectability
	on the transect line, indicating that assumptions of the technique
	were met during sampling. We found tortoises or their sign on 92%
	of transects in boulder habitat, on 71% that included incised washes,
	and on 25% in habitat with neither of these features (up to 1.7 km
	away from the nearest slope). Our results indicate that Desert Tortoises
	in the Sonoran Desert occur at low density, but are not absent, from
	intermountain valleys, and the maintenance of these valleys for tortoise
	movement between local populations may be important for long-term
	population viability. With this in mind, concentrating survey effort
	in areas with steep topography and boulders will increase tortoise
	encounter rate, result in better precision of regional density and
	trend estimates, and may also reduce survey effort.},

  abstract = {The chiru or Tibetan antelope \textit{Pantholops hodgsoni} has dramatically
	decreased in number over recent decades, and efficient monitoring
	of the density and distribution of chiru is vital to the management
	of this endangered species. We evaluated line transect sampling methodology,
	using track and cross-county transects, and assessed its conformity
	to underlying assumptions for use in estimating density of chiru
	in the ca 2,300 km2 Aru Basin, Tibet. Although violations of some
	assumptions were apparent, they were generally not substantial, and
	simple adjustments of sampling design can reduce their effects in
	future surveys. Sampling effort was not sufficient to demonstrate
	clear seasonal differences in chiru density between summer and autumn.
	However, cross-country transects on the west side of the study area
	did show a statistically significant higher autumn than summer density,
	and encounter rates (the number of detections per km) were significantly
	higher for both transect types in autumn. We tested for an expected
	negative bias associated with track transects, and although a clear
	difference in estimated density was not found, a significantly higher
	encounter rate was present for cross-country than for track transects.
	With increased sampling effort and a more effective design in future
	surveys, line transect sampling will be a useful methodology for
	assessment of chiru populations. © Wildlife Biology (2006).},

  title = {Hidden Markov analysis describes dive patterns in semiaquatic animals},
  journal = {Behavioral Ecology},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Existing methods of dive analysis, developed for fully aquatic animals,
	tend to focus on frequency of behaviors rather than transitions between
	them. They, therefore, do not account for the variability of behavior
	of semiaquatic animals, and the switching between terrestrial and
	aquatic environments. This is the first study to use hidden Markov
	models (HMM) to divide dives of a semiaquatic animal into clusters
	and thus identify the environmental predictors of transition between
	behavioral modes. We used 18 existing data sets of the dives of 14
	American mink (Neovison vison) fitted with time-depth recorders in
	lowland England. Using HMM, we identified 3 behavioral states (1,
	temporal cluster of dives; 2, more loosely aggregated diving within
	aquatic activity; and 3, terminal dive of a cluster or a single,
	isolated dive). Based on the higher than expected proportion of dives
	in State 1, we conclude that mink tend to dive in clusters. We found
	no relationship between temperature and the proportion of dives in
	each state or between temperature and the rate of transition between
	states, meaning that in our study area, mink are apparently not adopting
	different diving strategies at different temperatures. Transition
	analysis between states has shown that there is no correlation between
	ambient temperature and the likelihood of mink switching from one
	state to another, that is, changing foraging modes. The variables
	provided good discrimination and grouped into consistent states well,
	indicating promise for further application of HMM and other state
	transition analyses in studies of semiaquatic animals.},

  abstract = {Although previous studies have demonstrated high use of shade coffee
	plantations by Neotropical migratory birds, we still have a poor
	understanding of the suitability of shade coffee plantations as habitat
	on the wintering grounds. We studied density, body condition, and
	survivorship of Neotropical migrants, with emphasis on cerulean warbler
	(Dendroica cerulea), in primary forest and shade coffee plantations
	in Venezuela. We worked in three primary forest sites and three shade
	coffee plantations on the western slope of the Cordillera de MÃ©rida
	of the Andes Mountains. At each site, we surveyed migrants with distance-based
	line transects and mist-netted and banded migrants during November-February
	2005/06 and 2006/07. In addition, we estimated apparent monthly survival
	for cerulean warbler based on 29 color-banded individuals. Densities
	of migrants were 3-14Ã— higher in shade coffee plantations than primary
	forest sites, even after accounting for differences in detectability.
	Apparent monthly survival of cerulean warblers was estimated at 97%
	and overwinter persistence was similarly high. In addition, cerulean
	warblers demonstrated high between-season fidelity, with 65% of the
	birds banded the first year being resighted during the second year.
	Interestingly, immature birds returned at nearly half the rate as
	did adults. Banding data indicated that body condition increased
	significantly as the season progressed for cerulean warblers, Tennessee
	warblers (Vermivora peregrina), and American redstarts (Setophaga
	ruticilla). Collectively, these data provide evidence that shade
	coffee plantations offer high quality wintering habitat for Neotropical
	migrants, including cerulean warblers.},

  abstract = {Guanacos (Lama guanicoe) are the only wild ungulate species widely
	distributed across the Patagonian steppe and have undergone a precipitous
	population decline since the introduction of domestic sheep (Ovis
	aries) 100 years ago. There has been speculation that sheep ranching
	may have played a major role in guanaco population decline after
	monopolising the most productive land because of competition for
	forage plants. Our aim in this work was to estimate guanaco abundance
	and account for its variation across nine different sites, two seasons
	and two years. We conducted over 100 ground surveys of both guanacos
	and sheep and estimated the availability of the preferred plant species
	both animal species might select in their diet. We found that (1)
	sheep densities were up to 23 times higher than guanaco densities
	in sympatric conditions, (2) at a protected site without sheep, guanaco
	density was one order of magnitude higher than at the rest of the
	sites, (3) across nine different sites, sheep densities alone accounted
	for around 60% of the variation in guanaco abundance, (4) guanaco
	densities were negatively related to both total plant cover and availability
	of the preferred plant species in their diet, which were both positively
	associated with sheep density, and (5) within-site changes in guanaco
	densities between seasons and years were negatively related to changes
	in sheep densities. Our results are consistent with predictions on
	interspecific competition for food resources, although we cannot
	rule out possible effects of other human-related activities influencing
	guanaco abundance. We conclude that sheep compete with guanacos for
	forage in arid Patagonia.},

  abstract = {Using field data from brushtail possums \textit{(Trichosurus vulpecula)},
	we present a method for modelling wildlife detection probabilities.
	Whereas detection functions typically (e.g. for distance sampling)
	describe the probability of direct human observations of animal subjects,
	we adapted this approach for cryptic species where observation depends
	on animals being caught in traps. Specifically, we characterised
	the probability of individual brushtail possums being caught by leg-hold
	traps in an area of farmland and native forest in New Zealand. Detection
	probability was defined as the per-individual, per-trap, per-night
	probability of a possum being captured, and was modelled as a function
	of home-range utilisation. Radio-telemetry was used to define the
	home-range distributions of 18 possums, and a combination of scanning
	radio-receivers and movement-activated video-cameras recorded instances
	when radio-collared possums encountered and stepped on the trigger
	of leg-hold traps (inactivated by being wired open). We estimated
	a 5% chance of trapping individual possums with a single leg-hold
	trap located in the centre of their home range for one night (median
	value across possums). Furthermore, this probability decreased rapidly
	as a function of distance, so that at 120 m from the centre of the
	home range there was less than a 1% chance of trapping success per
	possum per night. The techniques developed in this study could be
	applied to a wide variety of species and sampling methods. © CSIRO

	only by males and are predicted to propagate up to 60 km
	
	
	codas (patterned clicks) and creaks (a series of very rapid clicks):
	Codas and creaks, which are of lesser amplitude, are not detectable
	far from their source.
	
	
	The frequency distribution of clicks (<100 Hz to 30 kHz,) extends
	above the dominant range of ship and flow noise, making these sounds
	easier to detect with a towed array system than the lower frequency
	sounds of baleen whales.
	
	
	Sperm whale clicks have a rapid rise time (<1 ms) which improves the
	precision of localization methods based on time-of-arrival difference
	between two hydrophones. A significant fraction of sperm whales are
	unavailable to visual observers (Kasamatsu and Joyce 1995, Barlow
	and Sexton 1996) because they can dive for an hour or more (Leatherwood
	et al. 1982); therefore, acoustic surveys are potentially more valuable
	for sperm whales than for many other species.
	
	
	MUITO INTERESSANTE (measurement error related):Our bearings represent
	conical bearing angles, and perpendicular distance estimated by these
	methods is the distance in three dimensions from the path traced
	by the towed array. Line-transect methods are based on two-dimensional
	distances from the trackline, measured at the surface. From the perspective
	of estimating linetransect density, acoustic perpendicular distances
	are biased and would be greater than the perpendicular distance at
	the surface unless the sperm whales were vocalizing at the exact
	depth of the array. Because sperm whales dive to great depths, this
	bias may not be trivial. Unfortunately, the bias cannot be corrected
	without knowing the depth of the vocalizing animals. We explored
	the likely magnitude of this bias by assuming that vocalizing sperm
	whales were at 600 m depth (slightly greater than the mean dive depth
	of 500 m reported by Whitehead (2003) and 500 m below the depth of
	the array) and by using the Pythagorean formula to estimate perpendicular
	distance at the surface from the acoustically estimated perpendicular
	distance.
	
	
	It is said later in the results that: Effective strip widths were
	also estimated with revised perpendicular distances based on an assumed
	whale depth of 500 m below the hydrophone array. For comparability,
	models were constrained to the half-normal key function. These effective
	strip widths differed from those given in Table 1 by less than one
	percent. For typical sperm whale acoustic detection distances, the
	effect of whale depth appears to have a trivial effect on density
	and abundance estimation. THIS IS BECAUSE THE WHALES ARE SO FAR AWAY
	(ON AVERAGE) FROM THE SHIP THAT THE PERPENDICULAR OR RECORDED DISTANCE
	ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
	
	
	Overall population size from visual detections was estimated as an
	average of the Beaufort-stratified estimates, weighted by the inverse
	of their variances. NOTE THIS IS ONLY SENSIBLE IF DENSITY IS INDEPENDENT
	OF SEA STATE},

	energy (Sa). The number of schools per nautical mile. EDSU (Elementary

	local school count and school backscattering energy to time-of-day

	The results indicate a considerable degree of non-linear dependency

	tended to be high during the middle part of the day and lower at
	dawn and dusk and were higher along the continental shelf edge about
	130 m west of Orkney and Shetland. The regression models, by definition,
	also allow variability due to each explanatory variable to be assayed

	explore further into the relationships among the schools. In this
	paper the residual variability from the regression models is used
	to describe density-dependent relationships among herring schools,

	influence the size (backscattering energy) of a given school?" It
	is concluded that herring school size is regulated mainly by location

	marmoratus)} to determine density off the coast of central California
	and to explore the utility of various survey protocols. Surveys were
	designed to compare line versus strip transect methods, and reveal
	the effects of distance from shore, viewing conditions and seasonal
	trends on density estimates. On consecutive days, we conducted 12
	paired (24 total) at-sea line and strip transect surveys that were
	20 km long at 400 m and 800 m from shore. We also performed nine
	surveys that were 10 km long and at distances of 400 m. 900 m, 1.400
	m, 2,400 m, 3,400 m and 4.400 m from shore. Density estimates calculated
	using line transects were significantly greater than estimates based
	on strip transects of 100 m and 200 m widths. Marbled Murrelet density
	ranged from 2.4-39.4 birds km-2 at 400 m from shore, and from 0.0-16.5
	birds km-2 at 800 m from shore. Density was higher on the 400 m than
	on the 800 m survey on 22 of 24 survey days. Densities measured on
	consecutive days were highly correlated on the 400 m transect but
	not on the 800 m transect. Line transect densities on the 400 m transect
	were higher when conducted under better viewing conditions. Line
	transects had higher statistical power to detect trends than strip
	transects. Statistical power analyses indicated only a 24% chance
	of detecting a population declining by 5% per year over 5 years when
	surveying line transects 20 km in length five times a year. Power
	to detect a 5% annual change increased to 57% when surveying line
	transects five times per year over 10 years. Survey design should
	strive to minimize variability in bird density in order to maximize
	likelihood of detecting population trends. An increase in the number
	of surveys per breeding season, length of a transect, or duration
	of monitoring effort should increase power to detect trends in murrelet
	density. We suggest that at-sea surveys should focus on detecting
	trends in density rather than population size.},

	used to provide a simple framework for the integrated analysis of

	has been applied to data on a range of bird species, on Soay sheep
	and on grey seals. This paper reviews the basic ideas, and then indicates
	the potential of the method through a series of new applications
	to data on the northern lapwing, a species of conservation interest
	that has been in decline in Britain for the past 20 years. The paper
	analyses a national index, as well as data from individual sites;
	it looks for a change-point in productivity, corresponding to the
	start of the decline in numbers, considers how to select appropriate
	covariates, and compares productivity between different habitats.
	The new procedures can be applied singly or in combination.},

	on two British bird species. For the lapwing, we calibrate how its
	recent decline could be due to a decrease in productivity. For the
	heron, there is no evidence for a decline in productivity, and the
	combined analysis increases significantly the strength of logistic
	regressions of survival on winter severity. },

  pages = { - },
  abstract = {Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central
	Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected
	to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites.
	We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large
	canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent
	and one tortoise. Two 4Â km transects at each site were repeatedly
	surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density
	estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416Â km.
	RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a
	mean extraction rate of 3.9Â m3Â ha-1, equivalent to only 1.1Â treesÂ ha-1.
	Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly
	different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative.
	Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject
	to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores
	were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish
	between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance
	metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite
	this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range
	size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain
	varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact
	logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively
	benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements
	of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our
	study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental
	effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an
	opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems,
	though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across
	tropical forests.},

  abstract = {A survey of apes was carried out between October 1996 and May 1997
	in the Dzanga sector of the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African
	Republic (CAR), to estimate gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and
	chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) densities. The density estimates were
	based on nest counts. The strip transect census and the line transect
	survey method (Standing Crop Nest Count) were used to estimate the
	gorilla nest group density. The strip transect has been most commonly
	used to date. It assumes that all nest groups within the width of
	the strip are detected, but as this assumption is easily violated
	in the dense tropical rain forest, the line transect survey was also
	used. In this method, only the nest groups on the transect line itself
	should be detected. This method proved to be an adequate and easy
	technique for estimating animal densities in dense vegetation. The
	gorilla density of 1.6 individuals km-2 (line transect survey method)
	found for the Dzanga sector is one of the highest densities ever
	reported in the literature for the Western lowland gorilla. The density
	estimate for chimpanzees was 0.16 individuals km-2 (census method).
	The results of this study confirm the importance of the Dzanga-Ndoki
	National Park for primate conservation.},

  abstract = {Finite population sampling theory is useful in estimating total population
	size (abundance) from abundance estimates of each sampled unit (quadrat).
	We develop estimators that allow correlated quadrat abundance estimates,
	even for quadrats in different sampling strata. Correlated quadrat
	abundance estimates based on mark-recapture or distance sampling
	methods occur when data are pooled across quadrats to estimate, for
	example, capture probability parameters or sighting functions. When
	only minimal information is available from each quadrat, pooling
	of data across quadrats may be necessary to efficiently estimate
	capture probabilities or sighting functions. We further include information
	from a quadrat-based auxiliary variable to more precisely estimate
	total population size via a ratio estimator. We also provide variance
	estimators for the difference between or the ratio of 2 abundance
	estimates, taken at different times. We present an example based
	on estimating the number of Mexican spotted owls \textit{(Strix occidentalis
	lucida)} in the Upper Gila Mountains Recovery Unit, Arizona and New
	Mexico, USA. Owl abundance for each quadrat was estimated with a
	Huggins 4-pass mark-resight population estimator, but with initial
	capture and resighting probabilities modeled in common across all
	sample quadrats. Pooling mark-resight data across quadrats was necessary
	because few owls were marked on individual quadrats to estimate quadrat-specific
	capture probabilities. Model-based estimates of owl abundance for
	each quadrat necessitated variance estimation procedures that take
	into account correlated quadrat estimates. An auxiliary variable
	relating to topographic roughness of sampled quadrats provided a
	useful covariate for a ratio estimator.},

  abstract = {<p>For biological populations that form aggregations (or clusters)
	of individuals, cluster size is an important parameter in line-transect
	abundance estimation and should be accurately measured. Cluster size
	in cetaceans has traditionally been represented as the total number
	of individuals in a group, but group size may be underestimated if
	group members are spatially diffuse. Groups of false killer whales
	(<italic>Pseudorca crassidens</italic>) can comprise numerous subgroups
	that are dispersed over tens of kilometers, leading to a spatial
	mismatch between a detected group and the theoretical framework of
	line-transect analysis. Three stocks of false killer whales are found
	within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone of the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaiian
	EEZ): an insular main Hawaiian Islands stock, a pelagic stock, and
	a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) stock. A ship-based line-transect
	survey of the Hawaiian EEZ was conducted in the summer and fall of
	2010, resulting in six systematic-effort visual sightings of pelagic
	(<italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š5) and NWHI (<italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š1)
	false killer whale groups. The maximum number and spatial extent
	of subgroups per sighting was 18 subgroups and 35 km, respectively.
	These sightings were combined with data from similar previous surveys
	and analyzed within the conventional line-transect estimation framework.
	The detection function, mean cluster size, and encounter rate were
	estimated separately to appropriately incorporate data collected
	using different methods. Unlike previous line-transect analyses of
	cetaceans, subgroups were treated as the analytical cluster instead
	of groups because subgroups better conform to the specifications
	of line-transect theory. Bootstrap values (<italic>n</italic>â€Š=â€Š5,000)
	of the line-transect parameters were randomly combined to estimate
	the variance of stock-specific abundance estimates. Hawaiâ€™i pelagic
	and NWHI false killer whales were estimated to number 1,552 (CVâ€Š=â€Š0.66;
	95% CIâ€Š=â€Š479â€“5,030) and 552 (CVâ€Š=â€Š1.09; 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š97â€“3,123)
	individuals, respectively. Subgroup structure is an important factor
	to consider in line-transect analyses of false killer whales and
	other species with complex grouping patterns.</p>},

	transect sampling is preferable to Pollard-Yates transects as a survey
	technique for monitoring Karner blue butterflies. The Pollard-Yates
	surveys do not adjust for differences in site detectability. As a
	consequence, estimates of among-site from Pollard-Yates surveys can
	be biased. © 1998 Chapman & Hall.},

  abstract = {The Mallee Emu-wren (Stipiturus mallee) is a threatened, narrow-range
	passerine endemic to south-eastern Australia. To inform future conservation
	measures for this poorly known species, we used ecological niche
	factor analysis, habitat suitability modelling and distance sampling
	to determine landscape-scale habitat requirements and estimate the
	population size. Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers
	of ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to
	derive and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological
	niche factor analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population
	distribution and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations
	in only five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We
	estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range
	8431-39, 104), 68% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals,
	with a single large reserve containing the majority (~92%) of the
	global population. The Mallee Emu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily
	occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for
	at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations
	containing at least a 15% cover of Triodia, however, time since the
	habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities.
	Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat to the global status
	of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is
	exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential
	for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of
	the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted
	recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to
	Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria.},

  abstract = {1. The ability to monitor abundance of animal populations is becoming
	increasingly important, in light of growing concerns over the loss
	of biodiversity through anthropogenic changes. A widely used tool
	for such monitoring is distance sampling, in which distances of detected
	animals from a line or point are modelled, to estimate detectability
	and hence abundance. Nevertheless, many species still prove problematic
	to survey. We have developed two extensions to point transect sampling
	that potentially allow abundance to be estimated for a number of
	species from diverse taxa for which good survey methods have not
	previously been available. 2. For each method, the primary survey
	comprises a random sample of points, or more usually a systematic
	grid of points, through the region of interest. Animals are lured
	to a point, or trapped at a point, and the number of animals observed
	at each point is recorded. A separate study is conducted on a subset
	of animals, to record whether they respond to the lure or enter the
	trap, for a range of known distances from the point. These data are
	used to estimate the probability that an animal will respond to the
	lure or enter the trap, as a function of its initial distance from
	the point. This allows the counts to be converted to an estimate
	of abundance in the survey region. 3. We illustrated the methods
	using a lure survey of crossbills Loxia spp. in coniferous woodland
	in Scotland. 4. Synthesis and applications. Two extensions of point
	transect sampling that use the same statistical methodology, lure
	point transects and trapping point transects, have been developed.
	Lure point transects extend the applicability of distance sampling
	to species that can be lured to a point, while trapping point transects
	potentially allow abundance estimation of species that can be trapped,
	with fewer resources needed than trapping webs and conventional mark-recapture
	methods. © 2006 British Ecological Society.},

	technique for estimating brood density of fledgling birds in forested
	habitats. During 1993 and 1994, we conducted 60 line-transect surveys
	on 10 sites in the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont. Sites
	were divided into two groups, which allowed us to test for differences
	in fledgling density between groups. We detected 508 broods representing
	38 species. Using standard distance-sampling procedures, we estimated
	densities of 0.576 (C.V.= 11.89) and 0.513 (C.V.=12.54) broods per
	hectare. Density was not statistically different between groups.
	As with other survey methods, distance sampling favors easily detected
	species; however, line-transect density of fledglings is less obtrusive
	and less labor-intesive than mist-netting or nest searches, and can
	contribute important information to studies of avian communities.},

	and fledgling brood density in the forested areas of 10500-ha sites;
	we compared a group of 5 disturbed-canopy sites (?10% canopy disturbance)
	with a control group of 5 undisturbed-canopy sites. We conducted
	456 point counts to determine species composition and abundance,
	and we conducted 60 line transect surveys to estimate fledgling brood
	density as a measure of productivity. Adult densities were not different
	between groups (P > 0.05) for 18 species listed as priority for conservation,
	although power was low. Combined brood densities of all species,
	Neotropical migrants, and ground nesters were not different among
	groups (P > 0.05). Brood densities of 3 Neotropical migrants also
	were not different (P > 0.05). However, combined brood density of
	area-sensitive, forest interior species was greater on control sites
	(P < 0.05). At the scale of this study, a minimal amount of canopy
	removal in the extensively forested landscape did not affect abundance
	and overall productivity of songbirds inhabiting the remaining forest,
	but canopy removal had begun to suppress productivity of some forest

  abstract = {Line-transect&#8211;based distance sampling has been used to estimate
	density of several wild bird species including wild turkeys (Meleagris
	gallopavo). We used inflatable turkey decoys during autumn (Aug&#8211;Nov)
	and winter (Dec&#8211;Mar) 2003&#8211;2005 at 3 study sites in the
	Texas Rolling Plains, USA, to simulate Rio Grande wild turkey (M.
	g. intermedia) flocks. We evaluated detectability of flocks using
	logistic regression models. Our modeling effort suggested that distance
	to a flock and flock size played important roles in flock detectability.
	We also conducted surveys from roads for wild turkeys during November
	2004&#8211;January 2006. The detection probability of decoy flocks
	was similar to wild turkey flocks during winter (decoy flock, 69.3
	&#177; 6.2&#37; &#91; &#177; 95&#37; CI&#93;; wild turkey flock,
	62.2 &#177; 18.3&#37;) and autumn (decoy flock, 44.1 &#177; 5.1&#37;;
	wild turkey flock, 44.7 &#177; 25.6&#37;), which suggested that using
	decoys was appropriate for evaluating detectability of wild turkey
	flocks from roads. We conducted computer simulations to evaluate
	the performance of line-transect&#8211;based distance sampling and
	examined the power to detect trends in population change. Simulations
	suggested that population density may be underestimated by 12&#37;
	during winter and 29&#37; during autumn. Such bias occurred because
	of incomplete detectability of flocks near roads. Winter surveys
	tended to have less bias, lower relative variability, and greater
	power than did autumn surveys. During winter surveys, power was sufficient
	(&#8805;0.80) to detect a 10&#8211;25&#37; change in population density
	in 8&#8211;12 years using &#8805;100 16-km transects or &#8805;80
	32-km transects. We concluded line-transect&#8211;based distance
	sampling from roads is an efficient, effective, and inexpensive technique
	for monitoring Rio Grande wild turkey populations across large scales.},

  abstract = {In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important
	disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral
	and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including
	salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known.
	We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after
	fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities
	of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy,
	5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon.
	We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three
	hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage
	on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds,
	and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage
	logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined
	the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species.
	We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities
	or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds.
	We detected significant differences for seven species, though the
	patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities
	of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker
	(P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee
	(Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata)
	were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to
	the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco
	(Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater
	in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged
	treatment. We detected significant differences between years for
	four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting
	and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some
	species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage
	logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging,
	the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative
	influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear
	to provide important habitat for some species of birds following
	forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies
	of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular
	locations.},

	estimated by capture-recapture and line-transect methods},

  pages = {63--85},

  abstract = {We estimated humpback and blue whale abundance from 1991 to 1997 off
	the west coast of the U.S. and Mexico comparing capture-recapture
	models based on photographically identified animals and line-transect
	methods from ship-based surveys. During photo-identification research
	we obtained 4,212 identifications of 824 humpback whales and 2,403
	identifications of 908 blue whales primarily through non-systematic
	small-boat surveys along the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington.
	Line-transect surveys from NOAA ships in 1991, 1993, and 1996 covered
	approximately 39,000 km along the coast of Baja California, California,
	Oregon, and Washington out to 555 km from shore. The nearshore and
	clumped distribution of humpback whales allowed photographic identification
	from small boats to cost-effectively sample a substantial portion
	of the population, but made it difficult to obtain effective samples
	in the line-transect surveys covering broad areas. The humpback capture-recapture
	estimates indicated humpback whale abundance increased over the six
	years (from 569 to 837). The broader more offshore distribution of
	blue whales made it harder to obtain a representative sample of identification
	photographs, but was well suited to the line-transect estimates.
	The line-transect estimates, after correction for missed animals,
	indicated approximately 3,000 blue whales (CV = 0.14). Capture-recapture
	estimates of blue whales were lower than this: approximately 2,000
	when using photographs obtained from the line-transect surveys as
	one of the samples. Comparison of the results from the two methods
	provides validation, as well as insight into potential biases associated
	with each method.},

	for field biologists and wildlife managers to become involved in
	the analytical summary of their research. An assessment was made
	of the ability of program DISTANCE to produce unbiased estimates

	of transect and population density. Populations were simulated to
	investigate the robustness of program DISTANCE to changes in the
	density, distribution, and detection of animals across sampling areas
	and transects. It is concluded that if distance sampling data is
	collected reliably from a random sample of possible primary sampling
	units (PSUs) it can be expected that estimates of density will be
	presented accurately and with correct estimates of variance. If the
	proportion of the study area surveyed by transects is large however,
	then the presence of large between PSU variation will cause the variance
	estimates from program DISTANCE to be a sizeable overestimate.},

  abstract = {We present a survival analysis of Soay sheep mark recapture and recovery
	data. Unlike previous conditional analyses, it is not necessary to
	assume equality of recovery and recapture probabilities; instead
	these are estimated by maximum likelihood. Male and female sheep
	are treated separately, with the higher numbers and survival probabilities
	of the females resulting in a more complex model than that used for
	the males. In both cases, however, age and time aspects need to be
	included and there is a strong indication of a reduction in survival
	for sheep aged 7 years or more. Time variation in survival is related
	to the size of the population and selected weather variables, by
	using logistic regression. The size of the population significantly
	affects the survival probabilities of male and female lambs, and
	of female sheep aged 7 or more years. March rainfall and a measure
	of the North Atlantic oscillation are found to influence survival
	significantly for all age groups considered, for both males and females.
	Either of these weather variables can be used in a model. Several
	phenotypic and genotypic individual covariates are also fitted. The
	only covariate which is found to influence survival significantly
	is the type of horn of first-year female sheep. There is a substantial
	variation in the recovery probabilities over time, reflecting in
	part the increased effort when a population crash was expected. The
	goodness of fit of the model is checked by using graphical procedures.},

	The abundance and density of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge was estimated
	by point counts with playback distance sampling from March-October
	of 1998-2000 in a temperate coniferous forest managed for timber
	production by a Mexican indigenous community. The average detection
	rate was 0.31 individuals per point, resulting in a mean estimate
	for population density of 20.9 birds/km2 and a mean population estimate
	of 2679 individuals, estimated using the half-normal key function
	with cosine adjustments. Density estimates of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge
	were 8 individuals/km2 in dry, open, scrubby habitats with deep ash
	and sand volcanic deposits subject to intense human use and in closed
	canopy, humid forests with moderate human disturbance. Density estimates
	were 14.6 and 21.5 individuals/km2 in humid, closed canopy, multi-stratified
	forests. The latter areas are recommended as the core area for protection
	of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge.},

	amount of survey effort required in a line transect survey in order
	to achieve a certain precision level in estimating the abundance
	of a biological population. Sequential procedures are constructed
	for both parametric and nonparametric animal abundance estimators.
	The criterion used to derive the stopping rules is the width of confidence
	intervals for the animal abundance. For each estimator considered,
	we develop stopping rules based on the asymptotic distributions and
	the bootstrap. A sequential analysis on an aerial survey of the southern
	bluefin tuna indicates substantial saving of survey effort can be
	made by employment of the proposed sequential procedures. This savings
	of survey effort is also observed in a simulation study designed
	to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed sequential

	assessed the potential utility of two marking methods for capture-mark-recapture
	applications following a mass canine rabies-vaccination campaign
	in Sorsogon Province, the Republic of the Philippines. Thirty villages
	selected to assess vaccine coverage and for dog surveys were visited
	1 to 11 days after the vaccinating team. Measurements of the distance
	of dogs or groups of dogs from transect lines were obtained in 1088
	instances (N = 1278 dogs; mean group size = 1.2). Various functions
	modelling the probability of detection were fitted to a truncated
	distribution of distances of dogs from transect lines. A hazard rate
	model provided the best fit and an overall estimate of dog-population
	density of 468/km2 (95% confidence interval, 359 to 611). At vaccination,
	most dogs were marked with either a paint stick or a black plastic
	collar. Overall, 34.8% of 2167 and 28.5% of 2115 dogs could be accurately
	identified as wearing a collar or showing a paint mark; 49.1% of
	the dogs had either mark. Increasing time interval between vaccination-team
	visit and dog survey and increasing distance from transect line were
	inversely associated with the probability of observing a paint mark.
	Probability of observing a collar was positively associated with
	increasing estimated density of the dog population in a given village
	and with animals not associated with a house. The data indicate that
	distance sampling is a relatively simple and adaptable method for
	estimating dog-population density and is not prone to problems associated
	with meeting some model assumptions inherent to mark-recapture estimators.

	sound repertoires are complete for the five coastal species: bowhead,
	gray, humpback and the southern and northern right whales. There
	are good representations for two pelagic species, blue and fin whales.
	Whale source levels (RMS power in dB re 1?Pa @ 1 m) have been reported
	as high as 188 dB (tabulated in Richardson et al. 1995). Under certain
	conditions (e.g., water depth that is not well matched to the signal’s
	frequency band of lowest transmission loss, or highly reverberant
	environments), there is little or no advantage to increased source
	level, and selection should favor changes in other acoustic features
	to optimize communication effectiveness and range.
	
	
	Two primary acoustic properties that strongly influence communication
	range are transmission loss (TL) and ambient noise. In a shallow
	water habitat (< 200-300m) sounds in the 100-800Hz band experience
	the lowest TL and there is often a window of low ambient noise in
	this frequency range. Along a shelf break or in deep ocean environments
	(> 1000m), sounds below 100Hz experience the lowest TL and between
	10-50Hz there is a plateau of low ambient noise.},

  abstract = {The decline of the Black-eared Miner \textit{Manorina melanotis} has
	been caused primarily by habitat degradation and vegetation clearance.
	To better direct conservation actions for this species there was
	a need to assess habitat requirements on a regional-scale and to
	estimate the population size using quantitative methods. We used
	vegetation mapping and the current distribution of the Black-eared
	Miner to determine regional-scale habitat requirements. These findings
	were combined with the results of distance sampling to provide population
	estimates. The species is restricted to large tracts of intact mallee
	in the Murray Mallee of southeastern Australia that have not been
	burnt for at least 45 years. The density of Black-eared Miners is
	highest in areas that are dominated by mallee-Triodia associations
	and have not been intensively grazed. The Bookmark Biosphere Reserve
	supports an estimated 501 (270-927, 95% Cl) colonies, containing
	3 758 (2 026-6 954) phenotypically pure Black-eared Miners, 2 255
	(1 215-4170) hybrids and small numbers of Yellow-throated Miners
	Manorina flavigula. However, the effective population size is considerably
	smaller (390 Black-eared Miners (210-726) and 234 hybrids (126-433)),
	due to a skewed adult sex ratio (1 female: 1.81 males) and complex
	social organization. A smaller population also persists in the Murray
	Sunset National Park containing 53 (32-85) Black-eared Miner/hybrid
	colonies. Both populations face a high risk of extinction from large-scale
	wildfire. The endangered status of the species under IUCN criteria
	remains warranted.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of animal abundance is fundamental to many ecological studies.
	Frequently, researchers cannot determine true abundance, and so must
	estimate it using a method such as mark-recapture or distance sampling.
	Recent advances in abundance estimation allow one to model heterogeneity
	with individual covariates or mixture distributions and to derive
	multimodel abundance estimators that explicitly address uncertainty
	about which model parameterization best represents truth. Further,
	it is possible to borrow information on detection probability across
	several populations when data are sparse. While promising, these
	methods have not been evaluated using mark-recapture data from populations
	of known abundance, and thus far have largely been overlooked by
	ecologists. In this paper, we explored the utility of newly developed
	mark-recapture methods for estimating the abundance of 12 captive
	populations of wild house mice (Mus musculus). We found that mark-recapture
	methods employing individual covariates yielded satisfactory abundance
	estimates for most populations. In contrast, model sets with heterogeneity
	formulations consisting solely of mixture distributions did not perform
	well for several of the populations. We show through simulation that
	a higher number of trapping occasions would have been necessary to
	achieve good estimator performance in this case. Finally, we show
	that simultaneous analysis of data from low abundance populations
	can yield viable abundance estimates. © 2006 by the Ecological Society

	roads (114 survey routes) in eastern Wyoming,
	
	USA, between June and August 2000. Detection probability varied among
	observers for both point-count and driving
	
	surveys. Detection probability was higher on point-count surveys (x–
	
	= 64.3%) compared to driving surveys (x–
	
	= 37.5%), and point-count surveys sampled a larger effective area
	away from the road. Walking line-transect surveys
	
	proved ineffective and inefficient for monitoring burrowing owls at
	large (statewide) scales. Nest-site detection
	
	probability was 47%during driving detection trials and 79%during point-count
	detection trials. We detected over
	
	twice as many owls per unit distance on our point-count routes (0.038
	owls/km) compared to our driving routes
	
	(0.016owls/km), but detected more owls per unit time on our driving
	routes (0.339 owls/hr vs. 0.229owls/hr on
	
	point-count routes). We detected 22% more owls using call-broadcast
	even though all of our detections on pointcount
	
	surveys were visual rather than aural. Estimates of breeding density
	were fairly similar based on our driving
	
	and point-count surveys (0.110and 0.074nest sites/km2, respectively).
	Standardized point-counts using call-broadcast
	
	along roadsides offer the best approach for monitoring population
	trends of burrowing owls at large
	
	(statewide) spatial scales. Based on our results, we developed a standardized
	survey protocol for monitoring burrowing
	
	owls at large spatial scales. Implementation of these monitoring protocols
	would provide more precise estimates
	
	of population trends of burrowing owls in North America.},

	from 29.82-31.58% (\bar X = 30.46%). Mark-recapture models were used
	to estimate abundance, which was converted to density using estimates
	of effective trap area. Tests of model assumptions provided by CAPTURE
	indicated pronounced heterogeneity in capture probabilities and some
	indication of behavioral response and variation over time. Mean estimated
	density was 1.80 mongooses/ha (range, 1.37-2.15/ha) with estimated
	coefficients of variation of 4.68-11.92% (\bar X = 7.46%). Estimates
	of density based on mark-recapture data depended heavily on assumptions
	about animal home ranges; variances of densities also may be underestimated,
	leading to unrealistically narrow confidence intervals. Estimates
	based on trap webs require fewer assumptions, and estimated variances
	may be a more realistic representation of sampling variation. Because
	trap webs are established easily and provide adequate data for estimation
	in a few sample occasions, the method should be efficient and reliable
	for estimating densities of mongooses.},

  abstract = {Since the heterogeneity of oceanographic conditions drives abundance,

	how foraging predators interact with their dynamic environment at
	various spatial and temporal scales. We examined the spatio-temporal
	relationships between oceanographic features and abundance of fin
	whales (Balaenoptera physalus), the largest free-ranging predator
	in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WM), through two independent approaches.
	First, spatial modeling was used to estimate whale density, using
	waiting distance (the distance between detections) for fin whales
	along ferry routes across the WM, in relation to remotely sensed
	oceanographic parameters. At a large scale (basin and year), fin
	whales exhibited fidelity to the northern WM with a summer-aggregated
	and winter-dispersed pattern. At mesoscale (20-100Â km), whales were
	found in colder, saltier (from an on-board system) and dynamic areas
	defined by steep altimetric and temperature gradients. Second, using
	an independent fin whale satellite tracking dataset, we showed that
	tracked whales were effectively preferentially located in favorable
	habitats, i.e. in areas of high predicted densities as identified
	by our previous model using oceanographic data contemporaneous to
	the tracking period. We suggest that the large-scale fidelity corresponds
	to temporally and spatially predictable habitat of whale favorite
	prey, the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), while mesoscale
	relationships are likely to identify areas of high prey concentration
	and availability.},

	status. Biopsy sampling is generally considered to be a relatively

	relied on subjective assessments of the behavioral response of individuals
	at the surface. The goal of the present study was to quantitatively
	assess the short-term effects of biopsy attempts on the behavior
	of short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) equipped
	with digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) off Cape Hatteras, North
	Carolina. We examined five metrics to determine if the behavior of
	whales was affected by a biopsy attempt, including: foraging behavior
	(number of dives, depth of dives, and number of prey capture attempts);
	time spent within 3 m of the surface; fine-scale body orientation;
	fluke rate and amplitude; and group vocalization rate. This first
	quantitative assessment of these quantitative metrics suggested that
	the short-term reactions to biopsy attempts are likely ephemeral
	and should not compromise the fitness of the animal. Most individuals
	exhibited a short-term increase in group vocalization rate following
	a biopsy attempt, which should be further investigated.},

	densities of three francolin species, Swainson's spurfowl, crested
	and Natal francolin. Surveys were conducted in Sporobolus ioclados-Acacia
	tortilis Savanna in the Nylsvley Nature Reserve. Relative species
	composition showed 75.7% Swainson's spurfowl, 16.9% crested and 7.4%
	Natal francolin. Early morning counts within two hours of sunrise,
	when temperatures are low and with no wind or cloud cover, revealed
	the best results. Detectability was estimated as 85.6%. The Uniform
	Simple polynomial model was selected based on the lowest Akaike's
	Information Criterion (AIC) values. Population density of all three
	species combined was estimated as 6.76 francolin/ha with an encounter
	rate of 32.24 francolin/km. A coefficient of variation of 23.57%
	and a poor model fit (AIC 1650.28; GOF \chi^2 P = 0.024) indicated
	that the line transect method may not be a suitable method to count
	francolin in this plant community. However, this method may be improved
	to some extent by including additional lines to increase replication,
	stratifying the study area into low- and high-density units, and
	including the adjacent Nyl floodplain into the survey. This study
	suggests a need to improve the line transect method and to investigate
	other counting techniques to assist in monitoring these species.},

	summers of 1997-98, 1998-99, and 1999-2000 we conducted line-transect
	surveys of Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) abundance off
	the north, east, and south coasts of the South Island of New Zealand.
	Survey methods were modified for the use of a 15-m sailing catamaran,
	which was equipped with a collapsible sighting platform giving observers
	an eye-height of 6 m. Eighty-six percent of 2061 km of survey effort
	was allocated to inshore waters (4 nautical miles [nmi] or 7.4 km
	from shore), and the remainder to offshore waters (4-10 nmi or 7.4-18.5
	km from shore). Transects were placed at 45° to the shore and spaced
	apart by 1, 2, 4, or 8 nmi according to pre-existing data on dolphin
	density. Survey effort within strata was uniform. Detection functions
	for sheltered waters and open coasts were fitted separately for each
	survey. The effect of attraction of dolphins to the survey vessel
	and the fraction of dolphins missed on the trackline were assessed
	with simultaneous boat and helicopter surveys in January 1999. Hector's
	dolphin abundance in the coastal zone to 4 nmi offshore was calculated
	at 1880 individuals (CV=15.7%, log-normal 95% CI=1384-2554). These
	surveys are the first line-transect surveys for cetaceans in New
	Zealand's coastal waters.},

  abstract = {The whiptail lizard \textit{Cnemidophorus vanzoi} is a large-bodied
	teiid found only on two islands (Maria Major and Maria Minor), off
	St Lucia, West Indies. In May 1995, 42 lizards from Maria Major were
	introduced to the smaller uninhabited Praslin Island on the same
	coastline. Three years post-release, we studied abundance, demography
	and morphometrics of the translocated lizard population, during a
	6-month period covering wet and dry seasons. Age, sex, snout-vent
	length (SVL), body mass (BM), tail length, tail regeneration, and
	overall condition (moulting, reproductive condition, cuts, external
	parasites) of 107 animals caught during the study are analysed in
	the present paper. Comparisons are also made with the source population.
	A body condition index (CI (BM/SVL)), sex ratio (adult males: adult
	females), age ratio (adults: juveniles), and sexual size dimorphism
	ratio (SVL adult male: SVL adult females) were calculated for the
	study population. Distance sampling and mark-re-sight surveys were
	used to estimate population size and lizard density. A total of 155
	± 26 individuals were estimated. The lizard population was found
	to have a high growth rate (r = 0.97-3.95). There were significant
	seasonal changes in lizard abundance. Seasonal differences in lizard
	numbers, BM and CI suggest either severe resource limitation during
	the dry season, or selective aestivation. A high frequency of tail
	autotomy may point to intense intraspecific competition as the island
	is relatively free from main predators such as the black rat Rattus
	rattus. Sex ratio, sexual size dimorphism and sexual dichromatism
	all indicate a territorial species in a generally non-territorial
	family (Teiidae). Some adult males seem to maintain juvenile colours.
	It is suggested that the introduced population has successfully colonized
	its new environment and that no significant change in the animals
	condition or size has occurred during the 3 years since translocation.},

  abstract = {Differences among observers in ability to detect and identify birds
	has been long recognized as a potential source of error when surveying
	terrestrial birds. However, few published studies address that issue
	in their methods or study design. We used distance sampling with
	line transects to investigate differences in detection probabilities
	among observers and among three species of grassland songbirds: Henslow's
	Sparrow \textit{(Ammodramus henslowii)}, Grasshopper Sparrow \textit{(A.
	savannarum)}, and Savannah Sparrow \textit{(Passerculus sandwichensis)}.
	Our review of 75 papers published in 1985-2001 found that the most
	commonly used methods were fixed-width transects (31%, 23 papers)
	and fixed-radius point counts (20%, 15 papers). The median half-width
	of fixed-width strip transects used by researchers was 50 m, but
	our results indicated detection probabilities were <1.0 at distances
	>25 m for most observers and species. Beyond 50 m from the transect
	line, we found that as many as 60% of birds were missed by observers
	and that the proportion missed differed among observers and species.
	Detection probabilities among observers ranged from 0.43 to 1.00
	for Henslow's Sparrow, from 0.44 to 0.66 for Grasshopper Sparrow,
	and from 0.60 to 0.72 for Grasshopper Sparrow for birds detected
	within 58-100 m of the transect line. Using our estimates of detection
	probabilities for Henslow's Sparrows among six observers in a computer
	simulation of a monitoring program, we found that bird counts from
	fixed-width transects required an additional 2-3 years of monitoring
	to detect a given decline in abundance compared to density estimates
	that used a method to correct for missed birds. We recommend that
	researchers employ survey methods that correct for detection probabilities
	<1.0.},

  review = {Analysis of the usual click rates of sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus
	at Kaikoura, New Zealand, confirms the potential for assessing abundance
	via “click counting.” Usual click rates over three dive cycles each
	of three photographically identified whales showed that 5 min averages
	of usual click rate did not differ significantly within dives, among
	dives of the same whale or among whales. Over the nine dives (n=13
	728 clicks) mean usual click rate was 1.272 clicks per second (95\%
	CI=0.151).
	
	
	Differences in vocal behavior among sperm whale populations worldwide
	indicate that estimates of abundance that are based on click rates
	need to based on data from the population of interest, rather than
	from another population or some global average.
	
	
	In order to provide absolute rather than relative abundance estimates,
	all the above-mentioned approaches require an estimate of the proportion
	of time whales are silent.
	
	
	
	The typical foraging dive cycle of a subadult male sperm whale at
	Kaikoura can be divided into four phases based on the whales’ vocal
	activity. These phases are:
	
	1. Directly after fluke-up, until the first usual click.
	
	2. During the dive itself, from the first usual click until the last
	usual click.
	
	3. Near the end of the dive, from the last usual click until surfacing.
	
	
	4. While at the surface before diving again.
	
	
	Jaquet et al. 2001 showed that sperm whales at Kaikoura are silent
	during phases 1 and 3, and that these silences last on average 25
	s and 3.6 min, respectively. While at the water surface, sperm whales
	are almost always silent Jaquet et al. 2001. During phase 2—which
	we assume is the foraging part of the dive—sperm whales produce usual
	clicks almost continuously Jaquet et al. 2001.
	
	
	Published studies of the mean click rate of sperm whales have generally
	analyzed one dive each of several individuals (e.g., Mullins et al.,
	1988; Goold and Jones, 1995), or have been calculated from many short
	recordings (Whitehead and Weilgart, 1990). These studies lack replication
	at the level of an individual’s dives. Our intention here is to present
	data quantifying variation in usual click rates within dives, among
	dives of the same individual, and among individuals.
	
	
	THEY HAVE ASSUMED PROPORTION OF TIME SILENT AS THE NUMBER OF SECONDS
	WITH NO CLICKS, WHICH SEEMS A PECULIAR WAY OF DOING IT!
	
	
	Estimates of the proportion of time whales spent silent during dives
	were virtually identical between the seasons and the two data sets
	(dive cycle recordings, summer mean =0.259, CV=0.138; winter=0.250,
	CV=0.141; randomly selected recordings, summer mean=0.261, CV=0.143;
	winter =0.251, CV=0.141). Taking surface interval into account, sperm
	whales were silent for 39% of entire dive cycles in summer (CV=3.8%)
	and winter (CV=5.5%; Table III).},

  abstract = {Line-transect analysis is a widely used method of estimating plant
	and animal density and abundance. A Bayesian approach to a basic
	line-transect analysis is developed for a half-normal detection function.
	We extend the model of Karunamuni and Quinn [Karunamuni, R.J., Quinn
	II, T.J., 1995. Bayesian estimation of animal abundance for line-transect
	sampling. Biometrics 51, 1325-1337] by including a binomial likelihood
	function for the number of objects detected. The method computes
	a joint posterior distribution on the effective strip width and the
	density of objects in the sampled area. Analytical and computational
	methods for binned and unbinned perpendicular distance data are provided.
	Existing information about effective strip width and density can
	be brought into the analysis via prior distributions. The Bayesian
	approach is compared to a standard line-transect analysis using both
	real and simulated data. Results of the Bayesian and non-Bayesian
	analyses are similar when there are no prior data on effective strip
	width or density, but the Bayesian approach performs better when
	such data are available from previous or related studies. Practical
	methods for including prior data on effective strip width and density
	are suggested. A numerical example shows how the Bayesian approach
	can provide valid estimates when the sample size is too small for
	the standard approach to work reliably. The proposed Bayesian approach
	can form the basis for developing more advanced analyses.},

	faecal pellets in conjunction with DISTANCE analysis as a method
	for assessing the abundance of kudu. Transects were undertaken in
	three regions of two game reserves and the results compared with
	helicopter based game counts (for two regions) and a known kudu population
	in the third region (an enclosed breeding centre). Estimates of kudu
	abundance were two to three times greater than the helicopter counts,
	but within the known number of kudu in the breeding centre. The increased
	accuracy in the breeding centre was probably because the transects
	covered a greater percentage of the available habitat (0.07%) than
	in the reserves (approximately 0.007%). We suggest that DISTANCE
	software and line transects counts of pellet groups can be used for
	kudu and probably for other ungulates in thicket-type vegetations.
	Accuracy will depend on the percentage of the available habitat that
	is surveyed and on the accuracy of the defecation and decay rates.},

	Variable area transect (VAT) sampling had been identified, and optimized
	relative to effort, in previous Monte Carlo simulated population
	studies as a low-labor field method that demonstrated superior estimation
	properties among many PDEs considered. However, natural populations
	tend to be much more complex and less predictable in spatial distribution
	than computer generated populations. Therefore, we carried out a
	Monte Carlo simulation study that used 17 fully enumerated field
	populations rather than simulated populations. These natural populations
	represented a variety of population densities and spatial patterns.
	We focused on assessing the effect of the number of population members
	searched for along each transect (r), sample size, and transect width
	on estimation quality. Using relative root mean-squared error and
	relative bias as criteria, the optimal range for r was 5 to 7 population
	members encountered from each start point. Sample size was best if
	n > 20, but returns in estimation quality diminished by n = 40. Transect
	width was previously uninvestigated and found to be the most important
	design factor affecting estimation quality. Field studies should
	strive for transects as wide as logistically reasonable.},

  journal = {The Journal of Wildlife Management},
  year = {2013},
  pages = {716–725},
  abstract = {We coordinated a large-scale evaluation of northern bobwhite (Colinus
	virginianus) population response to establishment of 9-m to 37-m
	linear patches (buffers) of native herbaceous vegetation along row-crop
	field margins as part of the Conservation Reserve Program practice
	Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds (CP33). We compared northern bobwhite
	covey densities on 1,088 paired row-crop fields with and without
	native herbaceous buffers in 13 states during autumn, 2006â€“2008.
	We used a 2-stage random effects modeling approach that incorporates
	the effective area as an offset in generalized linear mixed models
	to assess regional relationships among autumn bobwhite covey densities
	and covariates of field type (i.e., fields with vs. without native
	herbaceous buffers), ecological region, year, survey week, and contracted
	vegetative cover (i.e., planting native grasses and forbs vs. establishing
	through natural regeneration). Covey density was correlated with
	year and interaction effects of field type and ecological region.
	The year effect suggested annual variation in covey densities, whereas
	the field type by ecological region interaction suggested covey response
	to buffers was dependent on spatial location, likely reflecting differences
	in buffer establishment, succession, and characteristics of the surrounding
	landscape among regions. Mean fitted covey density on fields across
	all survey sites was 0.047 (Â±0.008 bootstrap standard error [BSE])
	and 0.031â€‰coveys/ha (Â±0.003 BSE) on row-crop fields with and without
	herbaceous buffers, respectively. Covey density was greater on fields
	with buffers relative to matched, comparison fields without buffers
	in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (241%; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and both
	the eastern (123%; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and western (60%; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01)
	portions of the Southeastern Coastal Plain region. Covey density
	was an order of magnitude greater in the central Texas region compared
	to other regions, but exhibited a small response to native herbaceous
	buffers, as did density of coveys in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie
	and Central Hardwoods regions. Disproportionate response to buffers
	in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Southeastern Coastal Plain
	suggests native herbaceous habitats might be limiting during autumn
	in these regions, whereas lack of response in the Eastern Tallgrass
	Prairie, Central Hardwoods, and central Texas regions suggests that
	herbaceous habitat either was not limiting or buffers failed to provide
	adequate requirements for bobwhites during autumn. Selection of other
	habitats to meet security and thermoregulatory needs might have resulted
	in lack of response in these regions. Native herbaceous cover provided
	by buffers can provide critical habitat in row-crop agricultural
	systems in some regions, and can contribute to regional population
	recovery objectives of the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative
	(NBCI). However, range-wide NBCI recovery objectives will best be
	met through multiple conservation practices in row-crop agricultural
	systems. Â© 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Recent cetacean mass strandings in close temporal and spatial association
	with sonar activity has raised the concern that anthropogenic sound
	may harm breath-hold diving marine mammals. Necropsy results of the
	stranded whales have shown evidence of bubbles in the tissues, similar
	to those in human divers suffering from decompression sickness (DCS).
	It has been proposed that changes in behavior or physiological responses
	during diving could increase tissue and blood N2 levels, thereby
	increasing DCS risk. Dive data recorded from sperm, killer, long-finned
	pilot, Blainville’s beaked and Cuvier’s beaked whales before and
	during exposure to low- (1-2 kHz) and mid- (2-7 kHz) frequency active
	sonar were used to estimate the changes in blood and tissue N2 tension
	(PN2). Our objectives were to determine if differences in 1) dive
	behavior or 2) physiological responses to sonar are plausible risk
	factors for bubble formation. The theoretical estimates indicate
	that all species may experience high N2 levels. However, unexpectedly,
	deep diving generally result in higher end-dive PN2 as compared with
	shallow diving. In this focused review we focus on three possible
	explanations: 1) We revisit an old hypothesis that CO2, because of
	its much higher diffusivity, form bubble precursors that continue
	to grow in N2 supersaturated tissues. Such a mechanism would be less
	dependent on the alveolar collapse depth but affected by elevated
	levels of CO2 following a burst of activity during sonar exposure.
	2) During deep dives, a greater duration of time might be spent at
	depths where gas exchange continues as compared with shallow dives.
	The resulting elevated levels of N2 in deep diving whales might also
	make them more susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances. 3) Extended
	duration of dives even at depths beyond where the alveoli collapse
	could result in slow continuous accumulation of N2 in the adipose
	tissues that eventually becomes a liability.},

  abstract = {Marked spatial autocorrelation was encountered in an extensive data
	set on Antarctic seal densities as well as Antarctic pack ice characteristics.
	Whilst me methodology of measuring spatial autocorrelation is well
	developed, there is no established infrastructure for statistical
	inference in terms of correlation analysis or ANOVA. We survey the
	literature that deals with these problems, as well as some of the
	approaches that have been proposed for taking autocorrelation into
	account in inferential statistics. We apply these approaches to a
	data set comprising Antarctic pack ice seal counts as well as a few
	environmental measures. In contrast to the predictions from the existing
	literature, nonlinear estimation suggested that Pearson's r substantially
	overestimates the tree correlation between seal densities and environmental
	variables. When compared to spatially adjusted analysis of variance,
	conventional ANOVA that compared seal densities or pack ice characteristics
	in different areas overestimated the degree of difference between
	these areas in proportion to the degree of spatial autocorrelation
	of the particular data set. In our case, the effects of spatial autocorrelation
	were not neutralised by treating entire transects as single points.
	These results emphasise the need for a methodology that takes spatial
	autocorrelation into account for interpreting the spatial data on
	Antarctic seals collected during the Antarctic pack ice seal (APIS)
	program. New software written for performing these analyses is available
	from the senior author.},

	sampling designs because the correlation structure for combinations

	that use fine-scale temporal data to arrive at biologically based
	definitions of available habitat, while naturally accounting for
	autocorrelation by modelling animal movement between telemetry locations.
	Sophisticated analyses that explicitly model correlation rather than
	consider it a nuisance, like mixed effects and state-space models,
	offer potentially novel insights into the process of resource selection,
	but additional work is needed to make them more generally applicable
	to large datasets based on the useâ€“availability designs. Until

  abstract = {Spotlighting (SL) is used widely to estimate animal abundance, but
	it yields density estimates that are underestimated and biased. Introduction
	of distance sampling has, to a large extent, contributed to solving
	these problems, but the reliability of this statistical method depends
	strongly on sample size. Thermal infrared (TI) imaging may improve
	number of observations, but very few studies have quantified performance
	of TI imaging relative to SL. This comparison is relevant because
	the high cost of a TI device is justified only by a significant increase
	of observations and a consequent reduction of labor costs. Our objectives
	were to compare animal detectability by SL and TI imaging as a function
	of animal size, species (red deer \textit{[Cervus elaphus]}, fallow
	deer \textit{[Dama dama]}, wild boar \textit{[Sus scrofa]}, red fox
	\textit{[Vulpes vulpes]}, European rabbit \textit{[Oryctolagus cuniculus]},
	and brown hare \textit{[Lepus europaeus]}), distance, and season.
	We also analyzed group size and composition for red deer and effect
	of grass height on detection of hares and rabbits. On average, TI
	imaging was more efficient (P<0.001) than SL, which detected only
	53.8% of the animals observed by TI imaging. This was especially
	true for wild boar (92.1%), but both devices observed comparable
	red fox (P=0.60) and fallow deer (P=0.72) numbers. Relative detectability
	of the 2 devices was influenced by different factors: for red deer,
	TI was more efficient than SL in summer and autumn, but not in winter;
	male groups of red deer were better observed by TI imaging than by
	SL; and wild boars were better imaged at short (0-100-m) distances
	with TI. Relative effectiveness of both instruments was not influenced
	by grass height (P=0.92). Our results showed that wild boar should
	only be surveyed using TI imager and that a strong improvement of
	sample size can be obtained using TI for red deer, brown hare, and
	European rabbit.},

  abstract = {We used distance sampling (line transects) and mark-resight to estimate
	habitat and local area (area size, range: 3.9-44.5 ha) population
	density of ungulates. The distance sampling study was performed on
	fallow deer \textit{(Dama dama)}, roe deer \textit{(Capreolus capreolus)}
	and wild boar \textit{(Sus scrofa)} in a mediterranean forest. The
	mark-resight study was performed on a roe deer population in a hilly
	area of the Apennines. The first study allowed us to estimate the
	animal density into four different habitats (deciduous oak wood,
	evergreen oak wood, maquis and open areas with domestic-pine woods).
	The between habitat differences of population density are large for
	the three species: fallow deer are more abundant in the open areas
	(22.22 heads/km2, c.i. 12.42-39.74), roe deer in the deciduous oak
	wood (14.50 heads/km2, c.i. 7.01-30.10) and wild boar in both the
	open areas (11.29 heads/km2, c.i. 4.86-26.20) and evergreen oak wood
	(10.42 heads/km2, c.i. 6.78-16.02). The roe deer population in the
	Apennines is characterized by large between-zone variations of population
	density (range: 1997: 13.25-131.31, 1998: 29.06-78.01, 1999: 10.67-88.58).
	Moreover, trends of local zones may be quite different with respect
	to the average trend of a wider study area, suggesting a well-defined
	short-scale spatial structure for this population. We conclude that
	both survey methods may be very useful in population assessment,
	but they need intense field effort and careful statistical design.
	Care needs to be taken to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical

  abstract = {We used line transect (distance) methodology to estimate the population
	density of fallow deer (Dama dama), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus),
	and wild boars (Sus scrofa) in a dense Mediterranean forest. Three
	different surveys (1 per year from 1995 to 1997) were analyzed. Density
	estimates, pooled among years, for fallow deer (9.9 deer/$\text{km}^{2}$,
	%CV = 24) and roe deer (8.5 deer/$\text{km}^{2}$, %CV = 21) were
	more precise than the estimate for wild boars (10.6 boars/$\text{km}^{2}$,
	%CV = 55). Fallow deer density was significantly higher during 1997
	than during 1995 or 1996. For wild boars, we found differences among
	years (1995: 23.6 boars/$\text{km}^{2}$, %CV = 23; 1996: 10.9 boars/$\text{km}^{2}$,
	%CV = 24; 1997: 3.9 boars/$\text{km}^{2}$, %CV = 33). We attempted
	a confirmatory analysis using an independent survey method for fallow
	deer and total counts at supplementary feeding sites for wild boars.
	These comparisons showed that line transect estimates were negatively
	biased for fallow deer during 1996-1997 and for wild boars during
	1997. For adults, the composition by sex from line transects was
	compared with information collected from fixed observation points.
	Differences in sex composition for fallow deer and wild boars were
	found when these 2 methods were compared. The structure of the roe
	deer population was similar when line transect information was compared
	with independent survey data. A spike in the detection probability
	function for wild boars may have been caused by the difficulty of
	detecting boars >20 m from the transect. The careful use of line
	transect sampling may prove useful for both research and management
	of fallow deer, roe deer, and wild boars.},

	was recently confirmed to be a subspecies in Mediterranean habitats

	at Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988, and detected an abrupt
	population decline in 2001. We compared distance sampling surveys
	undertaken before and after the population crash to determine the
	ability of this method to detect variations in animal density and
	to investigate which factors may influence the precision of the estimates.
	We used radio tagged roe deer to evaluate the accuracy of our surveys,
	comparing distance sampling and mark-resight estimates at the same
	site, and studying the behavioural reaction of the animals to the
	presence of an observer. We found that before the crash distance
	sampling surveys attained a good precision but that the survey conditions
	influenced both precision and accuracy. Post-crash surveys were less
	precise, but the difference in density, before and after the crash
	was highly significant, indicating the potential of the method to
	quickly detect density variations and so to allow wildlife managers
	to react without delay to a crisis. The direct test of distance sampling
	assumptions showed that estimates were almost unbiased. We conclude
	that the methodology was successful for monitoring this population
	and that it may be used in other situations where ungulates are rare
	and efficient monitoring must be attained with restricted budgets.

	content, logistics, and effort in native cordillera forest and eucalyptus
	plantations. We used programs CAPTURE and DISTANCE to generate population
	estimates and associated variances. Mark-recapture results showed
	density of E. coqui males was greater (P=0.04) in native forest.
	Total population estimates derived from mark-recapture were used
	with calling estimates to calculate proportion of calling males.
	Humidity was associated with density of calling males in native forest
	(P<0.001) and eucalyptus (P=0.01) plantations. Call counts of E.
	coqui within 5-m radius of points were correlated with density of
	calling males in native (P<0.001) and eucalyptus (P=0.001) sites
	and for combined data (P<0.001). We recommend that mark-recapture
	be used when detailed information is needed on an anuran species.
	Mean species richness detected between line transect (x=1.98) and
	point count (x=1.67) differed significantly; only one frog species
	was detected using mark-recapture. Point counts required the least

  abstract = {Many North American grassland bird populations appear to be declining,
	which may be due to changes in grazing regimes on their breeding
	areas. Establishment of water developments and confining cattle (Bos
	taurus L.) to small pastures often minimizes spatial heterogeneity
	of cattle forage consumption, which may lead to uniformity in vegetative
	structure. This increased uniformity may provide suitable habitat
	for some bird species but not others. We assessed how cattle use,
	vegetative structure, and bird population densities varied with increasing
	distance from water developments (0-800 m) on the Little Missouri
	National Grassland (LMNG) in North Dakota. Lark buntings (Calamospiza
	melancorys Stejneger), which are typically associated with low vegetative
	cover, decreased with increasing distance from water developments.
	Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris L.), also a low-cover associate,
	followed a similar but weaker trend. Densities of another low-cover
	associate as well as moderate- and high-cover associates were not
	related to distance from water. Vegetative height-density and litter
	depth increased by 50 and 112%, respectively, while cowpie cover
	and structural variability decreased by 51 and 24%, respectively,
	with distance from water. Confidence interval overlap was common
	among all measures, showing substantial variability among study sites.
	Our results indicate cattle use is higher closer to water developments,
	and this pattern may positively affect the densities of lark buntings
	and horned larks. The absence of density gradients in the other bird
	species may be due to the paucity of locations > 800 m from water
	on the LMNG.},

	using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon,

	Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single fire, 17 and 18
	years after a single fire, 2 and 3 years after a repeat fire (15
	year interval between fires), and >100 years since stand-replacement
	fire (mature/old-growth forest). Avian species richness did not differ
	significantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18
	years after fire, lowest 2 years after fire, and intermediate in
	repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied
	significantly with habitat type (AÂ =Â 0.24, PÂ <Â 0.0001) with two
	distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure
	(live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis,
	repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging
	bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by
	conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not
	related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height.
	Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity fire did not reduce
	species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns
	than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear
	to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou
	region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral
	broadleaf dominance and short-interval high-severity fires may be
	important to the conservation of avian biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The desert tortoise \textit{(Gopherus agassizii)} was listed as a
	U.S. threatened species in 1990 based largely on population declines
	inferred from mark-recapture surveys of 2.59-km2 (1-mi2) plots. Since
	then, several census methods have been proposed and tested, but all
	methods still pose logistical or statistical difficulties. We conducted
	computer simulations using actual tortoise location data from 2 1-mi2
	plot surveys in southern California, USA, to identify strengths and
	weaknesses of current sampling strategies. We considered tortoise
	population estimates based on these plots as ``truth" and then tested
	various sampling methods based on sampling smaller plots or transect
	lines passing through the mile squares. Data were analyzed using
	Schnabel's mark-recapture estimate and program CAPTURE. Experimental
	subsampling with replacement of the 1-mi2 data using 1-km2 and 0.25-km2
	plot boundaries produced data sets of smaller plot sizes, which we
	compared to estimates from the 1-mi 2 plots. We also tested distance
	sampling by saturating a 1-mi 2 site with computer simulated transect
	lines, once again evaluating bias in density estimates. Subsampling
	estimates from 1-km2 plots did not differ significantly from the
	estimates derived at 1-mi2. The 0.25-km2 subsamples significantly
	overestimated population sizes, chiefly because too few recaptures
	were made. Distance sampling simulations were biased 80% of the time
	and had high coefficient of variation to density ratios. Furthermore,
	a prospective power analysis suggested limited ability to detect
	population declines as high as 50%. We concluded that poor performance
	and bias of both sampling procedures was driven by insufficient sample
	size, suggesting that all efforts must be directed to increasing
	numbers found in order to produce reliable results. Our results suggest
	that present methods may not be capable of accurately estimating
	desert tortoise populations.},

	have declined or gone extinct in the past two decades. However, the
	extent of Eleutherodactylus population declines is unknown. Our objective
	was to identify a good method for monitoring the density of Eleutherodactylus
	populations to assess the extent of declines. We did this in two
	ways. First, we compared two methods of directly estimating density,
	closed population capture-recapture analysis and distance sampling,
	and one method of indirectly estimating density, visual encounter
	surveys, for multiple \textit{Eleutherodactylus} species at three
	sites in Ecuador. We then conducted a power analysis to estimate
	the power of our current sampling design to detect declines. Distance
	sampling estimates of density were biased low compared to capture-recapture
	estimates. When we corrected this bias, distance sampling estimates
	became imprecise. Estimates of density from visual encounter surveys
	were also imprecise. In contrast, capture-recapture estimates were
	fairly precise and most likely unbiased. Moreover, capture-recapture
	analysis had the most power to detect declines, although even with
	capture-recapture analysis, power was low with only five years of
	sampling. We conclude that capture-recapture analysis is a good method
	for monitoring \textit{Eleutherodactylus} density over time, but
	the sampling area and/or the number of sampling occasions should
	be increased from the area and number of occasions used here in order
	to increase sample sizes and therefore power.},

	regarding what constitutes habitat, and how importance is measured

	Added to the confusion is the idea that habitat is scale-specific.
	Despite these conceptual difficulties, ecologists have made advances
	in understanding â€˜how habitats are important to animalsâ€™, and
	data from animal-borne global positioning system (GPS) units have
	the potential to help this clarification. Here, we propose a new
	conceptual framework to connect habitats with measures of animal
	performance itselfâ€”towards assessing habitatâ€“performance relationship
	(HPR). Long-term studies will be needed to estimate consequences
	of habitat selection for animal performance. GPS data from wildlife
	can provide new approaches for studying useful correlates of performance
	that we review. Recent examples include merging traditional resource
	selection studies with information about resources used at different
	critical life-history events (e.g. nesting, calving, migration),
	uncovering habitats that facilitate movement or foraging and, ultimately,
	comparing resources used through different life-history strategies
	with those resulting in death. By integrating data from GPS receivers
	with other animal-borne technologies and combining those data with
	additional life-history information, we believe understanding the
	drivers of HPRs will inform animal ecology and improve conservation.},

	data from 13 nuclear DNA (nuDNA) loci as well as the mtDNA control
	region. Fixed diagnostic characters among the nuclear markers strongly
	support the hypothesis of three genetically distinct species, despite
	the lack of any diagnostic morphological characters. A phylogenetic
	analysis of all data produced a strict consensus cladogram with strong
	support at nodes that define each right whale species as well as
	relationships among species. Results showed very little conflict
	among the individual partitions as well as congruence between the
	mtDNA and nuDNA datasets. These data clearly demonstrate the strength
	of using numerous independent genetic markers during a phylogenetic
	analysis of closely related species. In evaluating phylogenetic support
	contributed by individual loci, 11 of the 14 loci provided support
	for at least one of the nodes of interest to this study. Only a single
	marker (mtDNA control region) provided support at all four nodes.
	A study using any single nuclear marker would have failed to support
	the proposed phylogeny, and a strong phylogenetic hypothesis was
	only revealed by the simultaneous analysis of many nuclear loci.
	In addition, nuDNA and mtDNA data provided complementary levels of
	support at nodes of different evolutionary depth indicating that
	the combined use of mtDNA and nuDNA data is both practical and desirable.},

  title = {Density estimates of nine hornbill species in a lowland forest site
	in southern Thailand},
  journal = {Bird Conservation International},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {16},
  pages = {57--69},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Hornbills are useful indicators of forest condition and human disturbance
	because they require large tracts of unfragmented forest with large
	fruiting trees for feeding and nesting. They are relatively large-bodied,
	which makes them targets for hunting. Density estimates of such species
	are critical for population monitoring and serve as a baseline against
	which future changes can be measured. In this study we used variable-width
	line transect surveys to estimate the densities of nine hornbill
	species in the Bala portion of the Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary on
	the Thai-Malaysia border, one of the few remaining areas of lowland
	forest in Thailand. The hornbill species were: Rhinoceros \textit{(Buceros
	rhinoceros)}, Great \textit{(B. bicornis)}, Helmeted \textit{(B.
	vigil)}, Black \textit{(Anthracoceros malayanus)}, Bushy-crested
	\textit{(Anorrhinus galeritus)}, White-crowned \textit{(Aceros comatus)},
	Wrinkled \textit{(A. corrugatus)}, Wreathed \textit{(A. undulatus)}
	and Plain-pouched \textit{(A. subruficollis)}. Between January 2001
	and April 2002, 11 transects along trails, old logging roads and
	one paved road were surveyed once per month. A total of 1,261 observations
	of the nine species were made during the observation period. Estimates
	for Rhinoceros and Helmeted Hornbill were 2.69 and 1.21 individuals/
	km2, respectively, and were similar or slightly higher than densities
	reported elsewhere. Estimates for Great (0.12), Bushy-crested (0.64),
	Wrinkled (0.08), White-crowned (0.08) and Wreathed Hornbills (0.69)
	were generally lower than estimates from other areas in the region.
	It was not possible to obtain density estimates using distance sampling
	for Black and Plain-pouched Hornbills due to the small number of
	observations, but our data did suggest that their densities were
	also low (>0.10 individuals/km2). Potential reasons for differences
	between this and other areas include a scarcity of lowland habitat,
	habitat isolation, lower abundance of specific fruit resources and
	interspecific competition, but these factors require further investigation.
	Standardization of survey techniques among studies would significantly
	improve assessments of habitat requirements as well as of the effects
	of human disturbance on Asian hornbills, most of which are globally
	threatened. Our study specifically underscores the need for additional
	research on the Plain-pouched Hornbill, the most threatened of the
	species studied, as density estimates from elsewhere in its range
	are lacking, while more generally it highlights the need to investigate
	the underlying causes of the often substantial variation in hornbill
	densities among species and sites. © BirdLife International 2006.},

  abstract = {Significant changes in the climates of Central America are expected
	over the next century. Lowland rainforests harbor high alpha diversity
	on local scales (<1Â km2), yet montane landscapes often support higher
	beta diversity on 10-100Â km2 scales. Climate change will likely
	disrupt the altitudinal zonation of montane communities that produces
	such landscape diversity. Projections of biotic response to climate
	change have often used broad-scale modelling of geographical ranges,
	but understanding likely impacts on population viability is also
	necessary for anticipating local and global extinctions. We model
	species' abundances and estimate range shifts for birds in the TilarÃ¡n
	Mountains of Costa Rica, asking whether projected changes in temperature
	and rainfall could be sufficient to imperil high-elevation endemics
	and whether these variables will likely impact communities similarly.
	We find that nearly half of 77 forest bird species can be expected
	to decline in the next century. Almost half of species projected
	to decline are endemic to Central America, and seven of eight species
	projected to become locally extinct are endemic to the highlands
	of Costa Rica and PanamÃ¡. Logistic-regression modelling of distributions
	and similarity in projections produced by temperature and rainfall
	models suggest that changes in both variables will be important.
	Although these projections are probably conservative because they
	do not explicitly incorporate biological or climate variable interactions,
	they provide a starting point for incorporating more realistic biological
	complexity into community-change models. Prudent conservation planning
	for tropical mountains should focus on regions with room for altitudinal
	reorganization of communities comprised of ecological specialists.},

	by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully
	reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock

  volume = {34},
  pages = {1273--1286},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {1. The reliability of deer population management could be improved
	with good density estimates, but current methods are either labour-intensive
	or suffer from uncertainties regarding accuracy. 2. Visibility varies
	substantially in forests depending on stand type, age and understorey
	vegetation. In such conditions distance sampling would be an efficient
	estimation method, but observer disturbance often results in bias
	when the method is applied to deer. 3. The performance of thermal
	imaging for estimating deer density by distance sampling was assessed
	in seven forest deer populations. Thermal imaging equipment can detect
	the long-wave energy radiated by natural objects, clearly revealing
	warm-bodied animals even if partly obscured by vegetation. 4. Many
	more deer were detected at night using a thermal imager than along
	the same transect routes in daytime. Detection distances were correlated
	with visibility but were substantially longer than the average distances
	at which most animals were disturbed. Most deer were detected without
	causing prior disturbance. 5. Densities were estimated with a coefficient
	of variation ranging from 10.2-28.4%. Precision depended on sampling
	effort and sample sizes obtained. 6. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed
	a quadratic relationship between accuracy and visibility, with accuracy
	increasing with average visibility and a tendency for deer to select
	more open habitats within a forest. Under conditions that are likely
	to be typical of temperate forests (< 40% thicket and neutral selection,
	or < 70% thicket if thicket is avoided), accuracy was generally good
	and changed relatively little in relation to visibility and habitat
	selection. 7. Likely sources of bias as well as alternatives to thermal
	imaging are discussed. It is concluded that the method would be suitable
	for estimating ungulate densities in forests with an adequate network
	of tracks.},

	diversity were low compared with other British scrub habitats. The
	two dominant species were Willow Warbler (52% of territory mapping
	registra-tions) and Chaffinch (18% of registrations). Densities derived
	from territory mapping and transect counts (Distance sampling) were
	similar. Willow Warbler densities were high and comparable with preferred
	habitats in lowland England and Fennoscandia. Contour mapping, correlation
	and canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that successional
	stage, represented by birch cover, was the single most important
	factor determining community composition and individual species'
	distributions. Meadow Pipits persisted at low densities in sparse
	birch; Tree Pipits occurred through-out the range of birch densities.
	Willow Warblers preferred areas of medium height birch at intermediate
	canopy cover. Wren, Great Tit and Long-tailed Tit occurred in older
	birch scrub. The relatively simple bird-habitat relationships reported
	are con-trasted with more complex patterns elsewhere. These findings

  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Current methods for estimating feral pigeon (Columba
	livia f. domestica) population size and for monitoring population
	trends are mainly based on indices, which according to the current
	literature on wildlife census methods often produce biased results.
	Distance Sampling techniques have never been used in this context,
	even though they could theoretically produce absolute abundance estimates
	at relatively low costs. The aim of this paper was to investigate
	the performance of Distance Sampling to census feral pigeons, and
	to compare these results with those obtained by using Quadrate Counts,
	a widespread method for monitoring these birds. Surveys were performed
	in Pisa (Italy) in two different periods of the year 2004 (end of
	Januaryâ€“beginning of February, and November), which correspond
	to minimum (Januaryâ€“February) and maximum (November) numbers for
	pigeon populations. We considered 40 line transects each about 250&nbsp;m
	long for Distance Sampling, and 40 250â€‰ï¿½â€‰250&nbsp;m cells for
	Quadrate Counts. In both cases, sampling units were randomized in
	a stratified design. In contrast to Quadrate Counts, Distance Sampling
	detected the predicted increase of abundance from Januaryâ€“February
	to November with an acceptable precision and no increase of costs
	per survey. Even though the possible biases (due to the not rigorously
	random distribution of transects and to the spiked nature of collected
	distance data) should be further investigated, results suggest that
	Distance Sampling is a viable and efficient alternative to the traditional
	methods used to estimate feral pigeons population size and to monitor
	trends.},

  note = {Landscape Assessment for Sustainable Planning},
  abstract = {Biodiversity on farmland is declining due to agricultural intensification
	and occurs across many taxa such as plants, insects or birds. Here,
	we modelled population sizes of five farmland birds in central Germany
	as the German Sustainability Indicator for Species Diversity (SISD)
	is based on this taxon. We explored options for sustainable farmland
	management by generating land-use scenarios at the regional scale.
	For individual bird species, high SISD scores could be reached by
	changing environmental variables, such as landscape or crop diversity,
	percent cover of spring cereals or hedge density. However, contrasting
	species responses to these variables prevented from reaching high
	scores for all species simultaneously. We were able to improve the
	total SISD score from 0.77 at present to 0.94 by increasing landscape
	and crop diversity or to 0.87 by increasing hedge density and reducing
	spring cereals, respectively. An economic evaluation of the return
	losses associated with these changes revealed that annual costs of
	approx. 5.5Â [euro]/ha farmland would suffice for this latter increase
	by optimizing hedges and spring cereals towards high SISD. We conclude
	that balancing three levels of trade-offs, i.e. contrasting requirements
	of species, diverging responses in different landscapes, and alternative
	economic options, is difficult to achieve without systematic modelling.
	Yet, by accounting for differences in landscape structure and species
	distributions at a regional spatial scale and by focusing on clearly
	defined measures such as hedge density or the cover of spring cereals
	rather than composite indices like landscape or crop diversity it
	seems possible to develop realisable, affordable and sustainable
	management strategies.},

  abstract = {Difficulty in monitoring the flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma
	mcallii) has led to controversy over its conservation status. The
	difficulty in detecting this species has discouraged large-scale
	estimates of abundance and led to uncertainty over whether the species
	exists in population sizes of sufficient size for long-term persistence.
	We incorporated detection probability into monitoring of this species
	using closed mark&#8211;recapture and distance-sampling methods.
	Density estimation from mark&#8211;recapture abundance estimates
	was improved using an estimate of the proportion of time lizards
	were on the plot. We estimated the probability of detection on the
	line for distance sampling and adjusted density estimates accordingly.
	We estimated the populations of the Yuha Basin Management Area in
	2002 and the East Mesa Management Area, Imperial County, California,
	USA, in 2003 to be 25,514 (95&#37; CI 14,444&#8211;38,970) and 42,619
	(95&#37; CI 23,161&#8211;67,639), respectively. Two estimates of
	detection probability on the line in distance sampling by different
	methods were 0.45 and 0.65. Density estimates derived from distance
	analyses for 3 East Mesa Management Area plots and the Yuha Basin
	Management Area were 1.55 per ha (95&#37; CI 0.64&#8211;3.76) and
	0.41 per ha (95&#37; CI 0.22&#8211;0.7), respectively. These are

  number = {5},
  abstract = {1. Large-scale habitat use of eight species of breeding birds was
	considered using data collected across Britain. The species were
	skylark \textit{Alauda arvensis (L.)}, dunnock \textit{Prunella modularis
	(L.)}, blackbird \textit{Turdus merula (L.)}, song thrush \textit{Turdus
	philomelos (L.)}, starling \textit{Sturnus vulgaris (L.)}, linnet
	\textit{Carduelis cannabina (L.)}, bullfinch \textit{Pyrrhula pyrrhula
	(L.)} and reed bunting \textit{Emberiza schoeniclus (L.)}. All are
	linked by roughly synchronous population declines over the last 25
	years in southern Britain (and mostly in farmland landscapes). Discussion
	is limited to the conservation status of these species. 2. Breeding
	densities were estimated for broad habitat types and these were used
	to estimate population sizes within habitat types. Confidence limits
	on the estimates were derived using a bootstrap procedure. 3. For
	most species considered, farmland holds a high proportion of their
	population (in excess of 50% for four species), reflecting the predominance
	of this land use across Britain. This suggests that sympathetic changes
	in farming practices are likely to provide the best mechanism for
	improving the status of these species. 4. Substantial proportions
	of particular species occur outside farmland, but different species
	occur in different habitats. A considerable proportion of skylarks
	occur on upland moor, bullfinches in wooded habitats, and reed buntings
	in riparian habitats. Conservation of this group of species thus
	requires appropriate management of the wider countryside, including
	their main habitats. 5. Habitats associated with human habitation
	hold > 20% of the British populations of blackbird, song thrush and
	starling, and considerable numbers of other species. The management
	of parks, gardens and other 'green space' may have an important impact
	on their populations and should not be neglected by conservationists.},

	rainforest. Almost 80% of these forests are within the Ilhabela Park.
	Although the species counted have marked differences in size and
	weight, density (individuals/km2) and estimated population size in
	23 500 ha of well-preserved forests were similar: \textit{Amazona
	farinosa} (13.82 ± 5.94; 3247 ± 1395), \textit{Pionus maximiliani}
	(15.79 ± 7.04; 3712 ± 1654), \textit{Brotogeris tirica} (15.05 ±
	4.87; 3537 ± 1143) and \textit{Pyrrhura frontalis} (13.06 ± 5.53;
	3068 ± 1298). Encounter rates of Forpus crassirostris and Pionopsitta
	pileata were very low, which suggests that there is only a small
	population of these species on the island. The Sao Sebastiao forests
	still support healthy populations of parrots. Although woodpecker
	population estimates on the island are large enough to provide nesting
	sites for parrots, competition for holes with other secondary cavity
	nesters such as toucans, flycatchers and tytiras, and the selective
	cutting of dead trees for canoe construction, which is a common practice
	on the island, may limit hole availability for parrots.},

  journal = {Journal of Wildlife Management},
  year = {1997},
  volume = {61},

  abstract = {The species-confidence hypothesis asserts that birds prefer mates
	whose colors match those of their species and avoid potential mates
	whose colors are atypical of conspecifics. Earlier point-count research
	indicated this mate-choice hypothesis also may explain avian reactions
	to observer clothing color. In central Texas, during January and
	February 1993, we tested further whether the species-confidence hypothesis
	holds for reactions to observer clothing color by determining how
	close an investigator could get to individuals before they flushed
	(approach distance) and how long individuals remained visible near
	their initial flush point (detectability period). The same investigator
	experimentally wore or did not wear a hunter-orange vest, which some
	wildlife biologists wear as a safety precaution during hunting-season
	field studies. The vest did not affect approach distance for species
	with red or orange on their bodies (American robin \textit{[Turdus
	migratorius]}, P = 0.247; northern cardinal \textit{[Cardinalis cardinalis]},
	P = 0.196: ruby-crowned kinglet \textit{[Regulus calendula]}, P =
	0.434; red-bellied woodpecker \textit{[Melanerpes carolinus]}, P
	= 0.113). In contrast, approach distances for species without red
	or orange were longer when the vest was worn than when it was not
	worn (Carolina chickadee \textit{[Parus carolinensis]}, P = 0.032;
	northern mockingbird \textit{[Mimus polyglottos]}, P = 0.033; yellow-rumped
	warbler \textit{[Dendroica coronata]}, P = 0.001). Differences in
	detectability period between vest conditions depended on air temperature
	for American robins (P = 0.003) and on the variation in visibility
	within habitats for northern cardinals (P < 0.001). Detectability
	period was shorter when the vest was worn than when it was not worn
	for Carolina chickadees (P = 0.057) and yellow-rumped warblers (P
	= 0.060). Thus, for several species this matechoice hypothesis seems
	to apply to garment color as well. Some species' reactions demonstrated
	that, if birds respond significantly to clothing color, important
	assumptions of distance-sampling techniques used to estimate avian
	richness, density, and abundance will be violated, and these parameters
	will be underestimated. Wildlife scientists will be more likely to
	draw valid inferences and recommend effective management practices
	from avian data gathered via distance-sampling methods if reactions
	to clothing color are precluded.},

  abstract = {1. The status of small cetaceans in the North Sea and adjacent waters
	has been of concern for many years. Shipboard and aerial line transect
	surveys were conducted to provide accurate and precise estimates
	of abundance as a basis for conservation strategy in European waters.
	2. The survey, known as SCANS (Small Cetacean Abundance in the North
	Sea), was conducted in summer 1994 and designed to generate precise
	and unbiased abundance estimates. Thus the intensity of survey was
	high, and data collection and analysis methods allowed for the probability
	of detection of animals on the transect line being less than unity
	and, for shipboard surveys, also allowed for animal movement in response
	to the survey platform. 3. Shipboard transects covered 20 000 km
	in an area of 890 000 km$^{2}$. Aerial transects covered 7000 km
	in an area of 150 000 km$^{2}$. 4. Three species dominated the data.
	Harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena were encountered throughout the
	survey area except in the Channel and the southern North Sea. Whitebeaked
	dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris and minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata
	were found mainly in the north-western North Sea. 5. Phocoena phocoena
	abundance for the entire survey area was estimated as 341 366 [coefficient
	of variation (CV) = 0.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 260 000-449
	000]. The estimated number of B. acutorostrata was 8445 (CV = 0.24;
	95% CI 5000-13 500). The estimate for L. albirostris based on confirmed
	sightings of this species was 7856 (CV = 0.30; 95% CI = 4000-13 000).
	When Atlantic whitesided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus and Lagenorhynchus
	spp. sightings were included, this estimate increased to 11 760 (CV
	= 0.26; 95% CI 5900-18 500). 6. Shortbeaked common dolphin Delphinus
	delphis were found almost exclusively in the Celtic Sea. Abundance
	was estimated as 75 450 (CV = 0.67; 95% CI = 23 000-149 000). 7.
	Current assessments and recommendations by international fora concerning
	the impact on P. phocoena of bycatch in gillnet fisheries in the
	North Sea and adjacent waters are based on these estimates.},

  abstract = {Numerous researchers have documented the adverse effects of feral
	donkeys Equus asinus introduced to semi-arid ecosystems. With the
	release of feral donkeys and potential increasing populations in
	natural habitats in northern Cyprus, there is concern for negative
	impacts on vegetation and native species. In the north of the island,
	there has been only one published study of feral donkey populations,
	and population estimators were relatively subjective. We estimated
	feral donkey populations on the Karpaz Peninsula using line transect
	surveys and quantitative distance sampling estimators. We stratified
	the sampling by using 11 sample units within the study area. We evaluated
	potential biases associated with habitat, topography, and perpendicular
	distance from the transect line and found that these variables did
	not bias donkey detections during our surveys. Using program DISTANCE,
	we found that a hazard rate cosine model was the best model that
	described our distance data based on model selection criterion (Akaike's
	Information Criteria adjusted for small sample bias). Estimated effective
	strip width was 280.19 m and detection probability was 0.47 with
	this model. Estimated donkey density was 6.7 donkeys/km 2, and estimated
	total abundance was 800 donkeys for the entire 132.5 km2 study area.
	Of 95 donkey groups detected: 16% were detected in agricultural habitats
	with flat topography, 9% were detected in agricultural habitats with
	sloped topography, 24% were detected in shrub/forest habitats with
	flat topography, and 51% were detected in shrub/forest habitats with
	sloped topography. Of 102 behavioral observations recorded (multiple
	behaviors were detected in groups), frequencies of behaviors were
	1% bedded, 70% standing, 22% grazing, 6% moving, and 2% other. Our
	estimated donkey population density in the Karpaz Peninsula was >2
	times densities reported in arid regions of the United States and
	Australia, but slightly lower than earlier density estimates reported
	for the Karpaz region. These estimates of feral donkey populations
	in the Karpaz Peninsula provide a quantitative baseline from which
	to make population management decisions. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

  abstract = {Results from previous surveys suggest that an area of the northeast
	Atlantic, the Faroe Shetland Channel, is important for cetaceans.
	This study utilised passive acoustic survey techniques to evaluate
	the density of sperm whales in the Channel. Two-week surveys were
	carried out during oceanographic cruises in May and October 2001,
	and May 2002. A two hydrophone array was towed behind the vessel
	throughout the majority of the survey routes and was monitored by
	a two-person team and by software designed to automatically detect
	and measure bearings to whales. Distances of individual sperm whales
	from the trackline were determined using target motion analysis.
	Standard line transect techniques were applied to calculate the density
	of whales during surveys. The effects of sea conditions and survey
	vessel on the ability to detect whales were tested; the encounter
	rate and effective stripwidth (esw) were estimated independently
	for each sea state and for each of the vessels. A total of 79 individual
	whales were detected, and their distances from the trackline were
	calculated. As a probable result of insufficient sample size and
	a small effects size, neither the esw nor the encounter rates varied
	significantly with sea state or between the two survey vessels. The
	density of sperm whales during each of the surveys was estimated
	to be 2.05, 0.52 and 1.75 whales per 1,000km2 for the May 2001, October
	2001 and May 2002 surveys respectively. Sperm whales were distributed
	across the majority of the Faroe Shetland Channel. This study has
	provided the basis for meaningful hypothesis generation in future
	studies and to gain a better understanding of the factors underlying
	the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of sperm whales in
	this area; data on oceanographic, biological and anthropogenic determinants
	should now be examined.},

	of native and exotic urban bird populations using a model adjusted
	for habitat-specific catch rates, cat ownership and hunting activity
	data. GPS-derived home ranges of 32 cats and resource selection indices
	demonstrated the degree of penetration and preference for native
	vegetation fragments. Owners reported on prey brought back by 144
	domestic cats in Dunedin, New Zealand, during 12Â months. One third
	of cats never brought back prey, and 21% returned more than one item/month.
	Cats brought back a mean of 13.4 prey items/year (medianÂ =Â 4),
	with cats aged <1Â year returning more prey than older cats. Birds
	were the most common prey, followed by rodents. Although cats penetrated
	adjacent vegetation fragments they did not catch more birds and preferred
	garden habitat, suggesting that predation pressure may be reduced
	in fragments. Cat home range size appears to be constrained by cat
	density while the number of birds caught depends on the density of
	available prey. Estimates of city-wide catch for six bird species
	were either more than total urban population size estimates or close
	to lower confidence intervals. Modelling of three species indicated
	low likelihood of population persistence with cat predation. The
	observed persistence of these prey species suggests a meta-population
	structure with urban populations acting as sinks with source populations
	located on the city fringe.},

  abstract = {<P> Aerial surveys of belugas, or white whales, Delphinapterus leucas
	, were conducted off West Greenland in March 1993 and 1994. These
	surveys were designed to permit comparisons with similar surveys
	in 1981, 1982, and 1991. Differences in methods between the surveys
	in the early 1980s and those in the 1990s should mean that the 1990s
	surveys were, if anything, more efficient than the 1980s surveys.
	Weighted linear regressions of strip-census estimates of the relative
	abundance of belugas showed a significant decline from 1981 to 1994.
	While annual variability in ice conditions and other unknown factors
	may have had some local or small-scale effects on the movements and
	distribution of belugas off West Greenland, it is unlikely that these
	effects would account for the apparent decline in relative abundance.
	The most reasonable conclusion is that the stock size has declined
	considerably during the past 13 years, perhaps by as much as 62%.</P>},

  abstract = {Interactions between cetaceans and fisheries are a major concern of
	cetacean conservation and fisheries management, as by-catch and resource
	competition occur as a result. To assess potential interaction between
	porpoises and fisheries in the German Bight, high-resolution spatial
	and temporal data were analysed in order to reveal association patterns
	between cetaceans and fisheries in the German Exclusive Economic
	Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea. To facilitate interpretation of resulting
	patterns, additionally, relationships of fish assemblages were analysed.
	Vessel monitoring system (VMS) data from 2006 and fisheries surveillance
	data from 2002 to 2006 were acquired to calculate fishing effort,
	aerial survey data from 2002 to 2006 to evaluate porpoise distribution,
	and trawl survey data from 2000 to 2007 to assess fish assemblage.
	Relationships were analysed in terms of seasonal association and
	overlap. Results showed that porpoise distribution was positively
	associated with sandeel fisheries in all seasons and with gillnet
	fisheries in summer. Overlaps for sandeel and gillnet fisheries were
	high in summer, while negligible in spring and autumn. In spring,
	high overlap was found for large beam trawlers targeting sole and
	plaice. In parallel, porpoise distribution was positively linked
	to fish assemblage components representing sandeel and poor cod in
	summer and flatfish in spring. Our results suggest that, especially
	in summer, resource competition between porpoises and industrial
	sandeel fisheries is likely and the risk of by-catch in gillnets
	is increased. In spring, interference with sole and plaice fisheries
	is to be expected.},

	spring (pre-breeding) and autumn (post-production) fox \textit{Vulpes
	vulpes} densities in three contrasting rural areas of Britain during
	1995-97. This was the first attempt in Britain to measure and compare
	fox densities over large geographical areas (630-1460 km2). Mean
	post-production fox abundance was estimated to be 0.90/km2, 2.62/km2,
	and 0.59/km2 in mid-Wales, the east Midlands and East Anglia, falling
	to pre-breeding levels of 0.41/km2, 1.17/km2, and 0.16/km2 in spring.
	As relative measures of regional density, these estimates are strongly
	supported by independent indices of fox abundance, and by the simultaneous
	survey of two sympatric species, the badger Meles meles and brown
	hare Lepus europaeus, which demonstrate the absence of any terrain-related
	bias. Absolute abundance is less easy to verify, but estimates of
	spring density based on breeding earth censuses support the transect
	surveys. For two of the three regions, fox density was close to levels
	predicted by extrapolation on the basis of landscape, but in the
	third region (East Anglia), fox density was substantially below prediction.
	Thus, results failed to support a hypothesis that fox abundance can
	be predicted solely on the basis of landscape and its close correlates.
	Rather, they favoured a competing hypothesis that an independent
	factor determines fox abundance in some regions. A likely factor
	is culling by man.},

	the results obtained with {LTDS} applied on trails and roads for
	two primate species \textit{(Callithrix penicillata} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Callicebus

	The results suggest that roads are not appropriate for use as transects
	in primate surveys, at least for some species. Further work is required
	to fully understand this issue, but in the meantime we recommend
	that researchers avoid using roads as transects or treat roads and
	trails as covariates when sampling on roads is unavoidable.},

	are many different approaches being studied. Within the framework
	of generalized linear models, one natural way of proceeding is to
	include additive random effects in the linear predictor. These random
	effects can be used to account for an additional level of individual
	variability (overdispersion); a shared random effect for the additional
	variance component in two-stage sample designs; longitudinal dependence
	in repeated measures designs; spatial dependence in disease mapping;
	etc. A common assumption for the random effects is that they are
	normally distributed, giving the generalized linear mixed model,
	where maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained using the EM algorithm
	and essentially fitting a mixture model. By a simple extension of
	this approach, it is possible to relax the assumption of normality
	and obtain a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate for the random
	effects distribution. In this talk we will give a brief introduction
	to the methodology and discuss several illustrative examples using
	the recent implemented R package npmlreg.},

  review = {Some of these axes are obviously more interesting than others, and
	this is why a factor analysis is introduced. The reasons are actually
	double. First, ecological variables are not independent. As more
	and more are introduced in the description, multicollinearity and
	redundancy arise. One aim of factor analyses is to transform V correlated
	variables into the same number of uncorrelated factors. As these
	factors explain the same amount of total variance, subsequent analyses
	may be restricted to the few important factors (e.g., those explaining
	the largest part of the variance) without losingtoo much information.
	Second, specialization is expected to depend on interactions among
	variables. For instance, the temperatureone species prefers might
	vary with humidity. Species may thus specialize on a combination
	of variables, rather than on every variable independently. Afactor
	analysis may allow extraction of the linear combinations of original
	variables on which the focal species shows most of its marginality
	and specialization.
	
	
	Ecogeographical variables are first normalized as far as possible,
	e.g., through Box-Cox transformation (Sokal and Rohlf 1981). Though
	multinormality is theoretically needed for factor extraction through
	eigensystemcomputation (Legendre and Legendre 1998),this method seems
	quite robust to deviations from normality (Glass and Hopkins 1984).
	
	
	The coefficients m, of the marginality factor express the marginality
	of the focal species on each EGV, in units of standards deviations
	of the global distribution. The higher the absolute value of a coefficient,
	the further the species departs from the mean available habitat regarding
	the corresponding variable. Negative coefficients indicate that the
	focal species prefers values that are lower than the mean with respect
	to the study area, while positive coefficients indicate preference
	for higher-than-mean values. An overall marginality M can be computed
	over all EGV as
	
	
	The coefficients of the next factors receive a different interpretation:
	the higher the absolute value, the more restricted is the range of
	the focal species on the corresponding variable. Note that only absolute
	values matter here, since signs are arbitrary. The eigenvalue h,
	associated to any factor expresses the amount ofspecialization it
	accounts for, i.e., the ratio of the varianceof the global distribution
	to that of the species distribution on this axis. Eigenvalues usually
	rapidly decrease from the second factor to the last one, so that
	only the first four or five axes are useful to compute habitat suitability.
	A validation data setcan be used to find out the best threshold value,
	e.g. through the ROC plot method (Zweig and Campbell 1993, Fielding
	and Bell 1997), given some a priori cost values to each type of inferential
	error. (HOW EXACTLY???)
	
	
	A basic tenet of the niche theory is that fitness (or habitat suitability)
	does not bear monotonic relationships with conditions or resources,
	but instead decreases from either side of an optimum. In this respect,
	our approachdiffers fundamentally from other techniques like discriminant
	functions or first-order regressions, where relationships are assumed
	linear and monotonic.
	
	
	These results obviously suffer from the same caveat as any inferential
	approach: a variable might turn out to correlate with one of the
	main axes not because of its intrinsic importance, but because it
	correlates strongly with another crucially important variable. ENFA
	is a purely descriptive method and cannot extract causality relations.
	Nonetheless, it provides (at worst) important cues about preferential
	conditions, and remains a powerful tool to draw potential habitat
	maps.
	
	
	Finally, a last important point to emphasize again is that our approach
	characterizes ecological niches relative to a reference area. Marginality
	and specialization are thus bound to depend on the geographic limits
	of the study area. Some species may turn out to occur at the very
	edge of their distribution, and may thus appear quite specialized
	in the reference set, however widespreadthey might be otherwise.
	Reciprocally, ibex would have appeared much less marginal and specialized
	had our sampling area been restricted to the Alps.
	
	
	
	With respect to more standard techniques, a crucial advantage of ENFA
	is that it does not require absence data. Presence data are compared
	instead with background environment. This of course implies that
	presence data should be unbiased samples of actual distributions,
	which we suspect might not be the case of many available database,
	since sampling efforts are frequently biased with respect to environment.
	
	
	In the case of stable populations from well-known species, one might
	prefer more classical approaches such as logistic regressions, able
	to extract relevant information from absence or abundance data. This
	point deserves proper investigation, in order to localize the threshold
	where the benefits gained from incorporating absence data are compensated
	by the costs induced by their possible poor quality. Investigations
	are presently in progress to compare the power of ENFA to that of
	classical logistic regression analyses under different biological
	and sampling scenarios, in order to assess their respective advantages
	and inconveniences. Preliminary results show ENFA to be more robust
	than classical logistic regressions with respect to several habitat-occupancy
	scenarios (Hirzel et al. 2001).
	
	
	The subjective components and a priori knowledge required are thereby
	kept minimal, and correlations among variables and axes are immediately
	visible and interpretable (I GUESS ONE IS JUST MORE PRONE TO FIND
	SPURIOUS RESULTS THAT WAY!)},

  abstract = {Distance sampling is a common and increasingly used method of estimating
	animal abundance in conservation and management programmes. The precision
	of a distance sampling survey can be estimated from the field data,
	but accuracy can only be evaluated by comparison with the true population
	size. For wild mammal populations, such opportunities are rare. The
	high-density badger Meles meles population at Woodchester Park in
	Gloucestershire, U.K. has been routinely and intensively live-trapped
	for the past 30 years. The estimates of abundance based on mark-recapture
	analyses of the live-trapping data provided a reliable baseline against
	which to evaluate distance sampling for a badger population. A distance
	sampling survey was carried out in autumn 2002 by using spotlighting
	along line transects. Owing to the impractical nature of spotlighting
	in closed habitats, such as woodland, surveys were conducted in open
	habitat only. A radio-tracking study provided behavioural data that
	were used to estimate the proportion of the population available
	for sampling in open habitats. This was incorporated as a multiplier
	into the DISTANCE analysis. The estimate of abundance from distance
	sampling was 76 badgers (% CV = 42.2), using a multiplier based on
	radio-tracking data from autumn only. When the multiplier was derived
	from radio-tracking data from across the whole year, based on a larger
	sample of tracked badgers, the distance sampling abundance estimate
	was 77 badgers (% CV = 25.9). These compared favourably to the mark-recapture
	estimate of 68 badgers (% CV = 7.4). The lack of precision in the
	distance sampling density estimate was largely owing to the inclusion
	of the multiplier. Distance sampling combined with data on habitat
	use can produce reliable estimates of badger abundance in areas of
	medium to high density, particularly in landscapes of primarily open
	habitat. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

  abstract = {During 1997, hundreds of thousands of Short-tailed Shearwaters \textit{Puffinus
	tenuirostris} starved to death in the Bering Sea. We surveyed the
	distribution and abundance of floating carcasses during a cruise
	between 27 August-12 September, and estimated that over 95 000 carcasses
	were afloat within three survey grids covering approximately 52 400
	km2. We repeatedly surveyed the same areas during two subsequent
	cruises in 1998 and 1999, and used standard population sampling techniques
	to evaluate the background levels of shearwater mortality during
	additional years when a die-off did not occur. The mortality event
	we observed in 1997 was unusual due to its extent and magnitude.
	During the die-off, dead shearwaters were sighted within all three
	survey grids. Conversely, we only encountered carcasses at one of
	these sites in 1998. Moreover, carcass densities in 1997 were at
	least one order of magnitude higher than those recorded during the
	following year. Surveys of seabird mortality at sea can account for
	floating carcasses before they are lost through advection and scavenging.
	Therefore, vessel-based surveys are likely to improve the accuracy
	of seabird mortality estimates based solely on counts of beach-cast
	carcasses. Here we describe the use of line transects to estimate
	seabird mortality at sea, and offer suggestions to standardize future
	surveys. Standardized surveys will improve our ability to compare
	the frequency, extent, and magnitude of seabird die-offs over time.},

  abstract = {This study reports extraordinarily high density estimates for the
	wild pig {(Sus} scrofa) from an aseasonal tropical forest site within
	the species' native range. At Pasoh Forest Reserve, a 2500 ha area
	of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia, line transects
	were used to estimate pig density from May to October in 1996 and
	1998. In 1996, 44 sightings of S. scrofa consisting of 166 individuals
	were recorded along 81 km of transects. In 1998, 39 sightings documented
	129 individuals along 79.9 km of transects. Estimated population
	density was \$47.0 pigs/km{\textasciicircum}2\$ in 1996 and \$27.0
	pigs/km{\textasciicircum}2\$ in 1998. Sus scrofa biomass in this
	forest was estimated at \$1837 kg/km{\textasciicircum}2\$ and \$1346
	kg/km{\textasciicircum}2\$ in 1996 and 1998, respectively. Differences
	between years were attributed to changes in the density of young
	pigs, coincident with a mast-seeding year of dipterocarp trees in
	1996. Pig densities at Pasoh Forest Reserve were much higher than
	at other forest locations within the species' native range in Europe
	and Asia. Because Pasoh Forest Reserve is a forest fragment, two
	factors likely account for the extremely high pig densities: (1)
	local extinction of natural predators (mainly tigers and leopards)
	and (2) an abundant year-round food supply of African oil palm fruits
	from extensive plantations bordering the reserve.},

  abstract = {1. Over the past 50 years, aerial counts have been widely used in
	African wildlife management; however, the accuracy of the resulting
	estimates has rarely been questioned. The reliability of aerial counts
	of large African herbivores was examined by comparing the results
	of a series of systematic aerial sample counts with those from a
	series of line transect foot counts conducted in the Lupande Game
	Management Area in Zambia. 2. For most large herbivore species, the
	estimates from the aerial counts were considerably lower than those
	from the ground counts. The data pointed to undercounting as a major
	problem of aerial surveys. During the aerial counts, significant
	numbers of animals were missed on the transects, first due to the
	low probability of spotting single animals, small groups of animals
	and less conspicuous ones (sighting probability bias), and secondly
	because part of the population was concealed by obstructions and
	therefore not visible to the observers (visibility bias). 3. The
	main factors that influence visibility of large herbivores from the
	air are the animals' reactions to an over-flying aircraft, dispersion,
	body size and colour. Animals that move in response to an aircraft
	are more likely to be seen than static ones; dark-coloured animals
	are easier to spot than light-coloured ones against a light background;
	large herds are easier to detect than small ones; and large animals
	are more easily seen than small ones. Body size is important while
	trying to spot grazers and mixed feeders from the air, while colour
	is important for spotting browsers. This is mainly due to the differences
	in habitat use, with browsers being confined to the thicker habitat.
	4. To minimize undercounting bias, both conventional aerial counts
	and aerial line transect counts should be restricted to large conspicuous
	grazers and mixed feeders in medium to large group sizes, such as
	elephant Loxodonta africana africana, buffalo Sincerus caffer, zebra
	Equus burchell, wildebeest Connochaetes and lechwe Kobus leche. Operational
	factors, such as height, speed and strip width, should be kept within
	reasonable limits for conventional aerial counts. Only one species
	should be counted at a time, always applying the double-count technique.
	For aerial line transect counts, the use of a helicopter is a prerequisite
	to obtaining accurate estimates. Other important considerations are
	observer experience and flight duration.},

  abstract = {The Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphin (Sousa chinensis Osbeck, 1765)
	is found throughout the western Pacific and Indian oceans, from southern
	China and northern Australia in the east to South Africa in the west.
	Throughout most of its range it has not been well studied, and in
	southern China very little is known of its biology. The goal of the
	present study was to provide scientific information needed for the
	longterm conservation and management of the population that occurs
	in Hong Kong waters. From September 1995 to November 1998, 38,105
	km of systematic line transect surveys were conducted throughout
	marine waters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
	of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and adjacent waters to provide
	data on distribution and abundance. Photo-identification of individual
	dolphins allowed for examination of movement patterns, home ranges,
	and social organization. Collection of stranded dolphin carcasses
	and detailed necropsies provided information on causes of death as
	well as samples for life history studies, such as feeding habits,
	growth and reproduction, ecotoxicology, and stock structure. The
	dolphin population appears to be centered around the Pearl River
	Estuary, and Hong Kong waters represent the eastern portion of the
	range, which extends far into mainland Chinese waters (Lingding Bay)
	and covers at least $1,800\ {\rm km}^{2}$. Within Hong Kong, dolphins
	only occur in western waters around Lantau Island. The area north
	of Lantau Island is heavily used throughout the year and represents
	by far the most important habitat in Hong Kong. Line transect analyses
	indicate that between 88 (spring) and 145 (summer) dolphins occur
	in Hong Kong. Based on 27,600 photographs taken, 213 individual dolphins
	were identified. The total size of the Pearl River breeding population
	is unknown, but is estimated to consist of at least 1,028 dolphins,
	based on line transect analysis. An apparent decline in the number
	of dolphins in the North Lantau area over the period from 1996-1998
	was not statistically significant. Individual dolphins have overlapping
	home ranges of about $30-400\ {\rm km}^{2}$ in different sections
	of the population's overall range. Groups of dolphins in Hong Kong
	number up to 23 animals, with an average group size of 3.8 +- s.d.
	3.63 animals. There is no significant seasonal variation in group
	size, but groups feeding behind pair trawl fishing vessels (mean
	= 9.6 +- s.d. 5.37) are significantly larger than other groups, and
	groups in Lingding Bay, in Chinese waters west of Hong Kong (mean
	= 8.3 +- s.d. 7.84) are significantly larger than those in Hong Kong.
	Groups are very fluid and change composition frequently, with association
	indices ranging from 0-0.333. Behavioral patterns are similar to
	those of other coastal dolphins, but Hong Kong hump-backed dolphins
	only rarely ride bow waves. Following pair trawlers represents an
	important feeding strategy for some individuals. Construction work
	on an airport fuel facility in the dolphins' main habitat appears
	to have caused some disturbance (indicated by increased swimming
	speeds) and possibly temporary evacuation of the surrounding area.
	There is a great deal of developmental variation in the color pattern
	of southern Chinese hump-backed dolphins, with a general lightening
	from newborn to adult stages. Males appear to retain more spots in
	adulthood than females. Length at birth appears to be about 100 cm,
	and postnatal development is characterized by rapid growth in the
	first year and a levelling-off of the growth curve after reaching
	adulthood. Asymptotic length is reached at around 243 cm. Length
	and weight are related exponentially, with the maximum weight about
	250 kg. Calving occurs throughout the year, but most young are born
	from January through August, with a peak in spring/summer. Scant
	evidence suggests that sexual maturity in females is reached at about
	9-10 years of age. Dolphins feed mainly on several demersal and pelagic
	fish species that are often associated with estuaries. There is a
	lack of evidence for long-distance movements (on the order of hundreds
	of linear kilometers), and this presumably results in isolation of
	groups around major Chinese river mouths. Thus it appears that there
	may be at least 8 separate populations of hump-backed dolphins along
	the coast of southern China. The Pearl River Estuary, including Hong
	Kong, is apparently inhabited by one of these populations, although
	preliminary genetic work has shown only equivocal evidence of population
	separation from dolphins in the Xiamen area. Human-related causes
	of mortality include entanglement in fishing nets and vessel collisions.
	Some environmental contaminants (especially the heavy metal mercury
	and the pesticide DDT) were found in high levels in some dolphins,
	and preliminary evidence suggests that these may be affecting the
	health of the animals. A series of recommendations for management
	and for further research have been made to aid in the conservation
	of these animals. Principles for the conservation of wild living
	resources should be followed, and information from both the natural
	and social sciences are needed for proper management. Research and
	longterm monitoring of the population must continue for management
	strategies to be evaluated and refined. Overall, the population of
	hump-backed dolphins that occurs in Hong Kong waters appears to be
	viable and should be able to survive with appropriate conservation
	efforts.},

  review = {Papers results based on the recordings from a single whale (although
	recordings from other whales in that whale's Tag are also used for
	analysis)
	
	
	Clicks from tagged and untagged whales can be distinguished in two
	ways: 1. Clicks from the tagged whale have low-frequency energy (below
	15·kHz) that is absent in clicks from other whales. 2. Clicks from
	the tagged whale can also be distinguished based on their angle of
	arrival.
	
	
	The amplitude of the clicks in these sequences will depend upon the
	distance to the clicking whale, the source level, and the angle between
	the directional sound beam and the tag (Zimmer et al., 2005). We
	maintain that much of the amplitude variation within a sequence is
	due to the third factor (aspect) as the range to the clicking whale
	will not change much over a period of a few seconds and thesource
	level of clicks is unlikely to vary from click-to-click by more than
	a few decibels (Au, 1993; Madsen et al., 2005b). On this presumption,
	the click with maximum amplitude in each sequence will be the closest
	to representing an on-axis version of the click (Møhl et al., 2003).
	
	
	Following the filtering operations, the root-mean-squared (RMS) level
	and SNR of each click in sequences of regular and buzz clicks were
	computed. The RMS level was calculated over the 97% energy duration
	of each click and SNR was estimated by dividing the RMS level of
	clicks by the RMS level in the preceding noise sample of duration
	0.5·ms.
	
	
	We have demonstrated that Blainville’s beaked whales produce two distinct
	click types associated with different phases of echolocation-mediated
	foraging. Long-duration FM clicks are used during the search phase
	and the initial approach to prey. When the target is about one body
	length away, the whale switches to buzz clicks.
	
	
	At a practical level, the unusual properties of FM search clicks may
	facilitate passive acoustic detection of Mesoplodon as a mitigation
	measure to reduce the impact of anthropogenic sound on this species.},

  owner = {Tiago},
  review = {Results from the study are directed at two strategies to reduce beaked
	whale mortality: first, with a specification of how and when these
	animals vocalize, it may be possible to develop systems for passive
	acoustic detection of beaked whales. Since beaked whales are so difficult
	to sight, acoustic detection is a critical method to monitor for
	the presence of these sensitive species before and during sonar trials.
	The second, longer-term strategy is to determine what factors heighten
	the risk of stranding and to identify opportunities to minimize these.
	If risk assessments continue to highlight an urgent need to define
	safe exposure limits for beaked whales, we propose to plan a pilot
	study on the behavioral responses of beaked whales to low levels
	of sonar-like sounds.
	
	
	This is the description of a project, with many interesting facts!
	
	
	Although the NOPP project only began in May 2004, we have already
	made a number of significant advances. With leverage from SERDP and
	U.S. Navy (N45) funding, we performed lengthy field seasons in our
	study sites in Italy and the Canary Islands. We have now placed tags
	on 7 Cuvier's and 3 Blainville's beaked whales. Our data set contains
	97 hours of on-animal recording including 44 deep dives and a remarkable
	9 hour set in which two Cuvier's beaked whales were tagged contemporaneously
	in the same group. Three whales (2 Cuvier's and 1 Blainville's) were
	tagged with high sampling-rate (192kHz) stereo DTAGs, developed this
	year, providing full-bandwidth recordings of the two species. The
	double tagging of Cuvier's beaked whales also provided an opportunity
	to estimate the source level and beamwidth of the click sounds. With
	this, and the movement information recorded by the tags, we can begin
	estimating the practicality of passive acoustic detection of these
	species as a mitigation measure.
	
	
	Several key results have already been obtained in the first year of
	the project. Using data from the new high-sampling rate tag, we have
	characterized the vocalizations of Cuvier's and Blainville's beaked
	whales over their full frequency band. These vocalizations consist
	of two distinct types of clicks which we refer to as regular and
	buzz clicks. Both click sounds occur at the base of deep foraging
	dives as shown in Fig. 1. Regular clicks occur at relatively stable
	intervals of 0.2 to 0.4s throughout the base of the dive while buzz
	clicks occur in occasional short bursts with inter-click-intervals
	of about 5ms. Echoes from approaching targets in the water, recorded
	by the tags, confirm an echolocation function of both click types
	and represent the first time that echoes from prey have been recorded
	on a marine mammal. Based on our findings with sperm whales [Miller
	2004], we associate buzz clicks with the terminal phase of a capture
	sequence. Recordings of buzzes with echoes from prey, made by the
	tag, provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate prey selection
	and capture, and to estimate foraging efficiency [Madsen 2005]. Regular
	clicks from both beaked whale species have a long duration (200µs)
	and a distinctive frequency-modulated sweep characteristic, making
	them unique amongst the odontocetes studied to date. This kind of
	click may be tailored to discriminate targets in a highly cluttered
	acoustic environment such as we have observed in the tag recordings.
	In contrast, the buzz click is of short duration (about 60µs) and
	is broadband without obvious modulation. The ability to produce two
	distinct click types has not been described for other odontocetes
	and may represent a specialization for deep-water foraging. These
	results have relevance in understanding the habitat selection of
	beaked whales and in designing passive acoustic monitoring systems
	for these species. In particular, the distinctive regular clicks
	may hold the key to discriminating beaked whale sounds from those
	of ubiquitous species such as dolphin that appear to be less sensitive
	to sonars. We have submitted a paper describing the broadband clicks
	of Cuvier's beaked whale [Zimmer, subm.] and are currently preparing
	a paper on those of Blainville's beaked whale.
	
	
	COOL POINT I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE: Beaked whales are most often observed
	in small groups at the surface and are seen to dive synchronously.
	The use of a stereo acoustic recording tag this year has provided
	an opportunity to study the behavior of the group during foraging
	dives. Regular and buzz clicks from untagged whales in the group
	are frequently heard in the stereo tag recording and the sounds from
	individuals can be distinguished by their angle-of-arrival. We have
	been able to count the number of individuals present during a foraging
	dive and compare it to surface observations of the same group. In
	each case, most orall of the whales in the group are present in the
	deep dive, including juveniles. This suggests that dive duration
	may be determined by the least-capable (e.g., smallest) animal in
	the group, an interesting counterpoint to the traditional optimal
	foraging paradigm. If, as is likely, vocalizations mediate this cohesion,
	then there is a risk that anthropogenic sound such as from sonars
	may disrupt group communication and thus behavior.},

	developed to monitor the behavior of marine mammals, and their response
	to sound, continuously throughout the dive cycle. The tag contains
	a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from
	a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the
	orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed
	and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor
	recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion
	can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than
	30 northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales
	(Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per
	deployment. Several deployments have included sound playbacks to
	the tagged whale and a transient response to at least one playback
	is evident in the tag data.},

	The DTAG has been designed specifically for studies on how wild marine
	mammals respond to sound. The noninvasive tag provides short-term
	but highly detailed information about the acoustic environment and
	behavior of the host animal. By combining accelerometer and magnetometer
	signals, the orientation of the animal can be determined accurately
	and with sufficient resolution to capture individual fluke-strokes
	and subtle movements. Results from tagging two large whale species
	demonstrate the broad range of inferences that can be made from the
	tag data and suggest that it can detect most movements and vocal
	behaviors of a whale continuously throughout the dive cycle. In addition
	to establishing behavioral responses to natural and anthropogenic
	sounds, it may be possible to use tag data to estimate the energetic
	cost of such responses. This information is sorely needed in setting

	optimal monitoring strategy by simulating a manager collecting data
	on a declining species, the Chestnut-rumped Hylacola (</I>Hylacola
	pyrrhopygia parkeri<I>), to determine whether the species should
	be listed under the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Red List. We
	compared the efficiencies of two strategies for detecting trend,
	abundance, and presence-absence surveys, under financial constraints.
	One might expect the abundance surveys to be superior under all circumstances
	because more information is collected at each site. Nevertheless,
	the presence-absence data can be collected at more sites because
	the surveyor is not obliged to spend a fixed amount of time at each
	site. The optimal strategy for monitoring was very dependent on the
	budget available. Under some circumstances, presence-absence surveys
	outperformed abundance surveys for diagnosing the IUCN Red List categories
	cost-effectively. Abundance surveys were best if the species was
	expected to be recorded more than 16 times&#47;year; otherwise, presence-absence
	surveys were best. The relationship between the strategies we investigated

	 grew fast, mostly during the first 3 yr of life, and may live beyond
	15 yr. By recording the exact
	
	 location of each P. nobilis individual within 800 m2 transects, as
	a pair of coordinates, the exact spatial
	
	 distribution was defined and aggregation indices were calculated.
	P. nobilis had an aggregated
	
	 dispersion, but no evidence for preferential settlement near adults
	or previously-settled individuals
	
	 was found. The aggregated dispersion of P. nobilis probably relates
	to the patchiness of the local
	
	 environment. The size of P. nobilis population in Lake Vouliagmeni
	was estimated to be 8501 ± 4395
	
	 (mean ± 1 SD) individuals, of which 4355 ± 3460 belonged to the first
	age class and 4146 ± 1405
	
	 belonged to all other age classes.},

  abstract = {Abundance estimation in ecology is usually accomplished by capture-recapture,
	removal, or distance sampling methods. These may be hard to implement
	at large spatial scales. In contrast, binomial mixture models enable
	abundance estimation without individual identification, based simply
	on temporally and spatially replicated counts. Here, we evaluate
	mixture models using data from the national breeding bird monitoring
	program in Switzerland, where some 250 1-km2 quadrats are surveyed
	using the territory mapping method three times during each breeding
	season. We chose eight species with contrasting distribution (wide-narrow),
	abundance (high-low), and detectability (easy-difficult). Abundance
	was modeled as a random effect with a Poisson or negative binomial
	distribution, with mean affected by forest cover, elevation, and
	route length. Detectability was a logit-linear function of survey
	date, survey date-by-elevation, and sampling effort (time per transect
	unit). Resulting covariate effects and parameter estimates were consistent
	with expectations. Detectability per territory (for three surveys)
	ranged from 0.66 to 0.94 (mean 0.84) for easy species, and from 0.16
	to 0.83 (mean 0.53) for difficult species, depended on survey effort
	for two easy and all four difficult species, and changed seasonally
	for three easy and three difficult species. Abundance was positively
	related to route length in three high-abundance and one low-abundance
	(one easy and three difficult) species, and increased with forest
	cover in five forest species, decreased for two nonforest species,
	and was unaffected for a generalist species. Abundance estimates
	under the most parsimonious mixture models were between 1.1 and 8.9
	(median 1.8) times greater than estimates based on territory mapping;
	hence, three surveys were insufficient to detect all territories
	for each species. We conclude that binomial mixture models are an
	important new approach for estimating abundance corrected for detectability
	when only repeated-count data are available. Future developments
	envisioned include estimation of trend, occupancy, and total regional
	abundance. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	effects models, offering another approach to studying temporal variation

	and 2005, we compared scrub-shrub bird abundance, nest success, and

	in western Massachusetts to determine whether the habitats created
	by these practices are equivalent for birds. We recorded 1927 detections
	of 31 scrub-shrub bird species during the course of the study and
	monitored 368 nests. We found that although most species were present
	in both treatments, many differed in abundance between wildlife and
	silvicultural openings, including several species of high conservation
	concern. These differences were attributable to differences in habitat
	characteristics between treatments. The overall probability of a
	nest surviving to fledging was 0.43, and did not differ between wildlife
	and silvicultural openings. Our results indicate that the habitat
	quality of wildlife and silvicultural openings is not equivalent
	for scrub-shrub birds, but the two management approaches serve as
	complementary strategies for maintaining these declining species.},

  abstract = {The paper is about the accurate (i.e. unbiased and precise) and efficient
	estimation of structural indices in forest stands. We present SIAFOR,
	a computer programme for the calculation of four nearest-neighbour
	indices, which describe the spatial arrangement of tree positions,
	the distribution pattern of species, and the size differentiation
	between trees. The study uses SIAFOR as a sampling simulator in eight
	completely stem-mapped forest stands of varying area and structural
	complexity. We statistically evaluate two sample types (distance
	and plot sampling), comparing sampling error, bias and minimum sample
	size for index estimation. We introduce the concepts of measurement
	expansion factor (MEF) and design expansion factor (DEF) for the
	technical evaluation of sample type efficiency (optimal sample type).
	Results indicate that sampling error can reach high levels and that
	minimum sample sizes for index estimation often amply exceed the
	limit of 20% of tree density or 20 trees per species per hectare,
	that we set as the highest feasible sample size in normal situations.
	We found clear feasibility limits (in terms of minimal tree densities
	and reachable accuracy levels) for the estimation of all investigated
	indices. Generally, equal or higher sample sizes are needed for plot
	sampling than for distance sampling to reach equal accuracy levels.
	Nevertheless, plot sampling resulted more efficient for the estimation
	of tree size differentiation at low to medium accuracy levels. For
	all other investigated indices distance sampling resulted more efficient
	than plot sampling. Minimum sample size increases with accuracy and
	is negatively correlated with tree density. At a given accuracy level
	minimum sample size is highest for the estimation of relative mingling
	and lowest for tree size differentiation; furthermore it is generally
	lower in large stands than in small ones. Because of the consistency
	of our conclusions in all of the investigated stands, we think they
	apply in most stands of similar area (between 1 and 10 ha) and species
	diversity (not more than four species). © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract = {Point counts are the method most commonly used to estimate abundance
	of birds, but they often fail to account properly for incomplete
	and variable detection probabilities. We developed a technique that
	combines distance and double-observer sampling to estimate detection
	probabilities and effective area surveyed. We applied this paired-observer,
	variable circular-plot (POVCP) technique to point-count surveys (n
	= 753) conducted in closed-canopy forests of southeast Alaska. Distance
	data were analyzed for each species to model a detection probability
	for each observer and calculate an estimate of density. We then multiplied
	each observer's density estimates by a correction factor to adjust
	for detection probabilities <1 at plot center. We compared analytical
	results from four survey methods: single-observer fixed-radius (50-m)
	plot; single-observer, variable circular-plot (SOVCP); double-observer
	fixed-radius (50-m) plot; and POVCP. We examined differences in detection
	probabilities at plot center, effective area surveyed, and densities
	for five bird species: Pacific-slope Flycatcher \textit{(Empidonax
	difficilis)}, Winter Wren \textit{(Troglodytes troglodytes)}, Golden-crowned
	Kinglet \textit{(Regulus satrapa)}, Hermit Thrush \textit{(Catharus
	guttatus)}, and Townsend's Warbler \textit{(Dendroica townsendi)}.
	Average detection probabilities for paired observers increased ?8%
	(SE = 2.9) for all species once estimates were corrected for birds
	missed at plot center. Density estimators of fixed-radius survey
	methods were likely negatively biased, because the key assumption
	of perfect detection was not met. Density estimates generated using
	SOVCP and POVCP were similar, but standard errors were much lower
	for the POVCP survey method. We recommend using POVCP when study
	objectives require precise estimates of density. Failure to account
	for differences in detection probabilities and effective area surveyed
	results in biased population estimators and, therefore, faulty inferences
	about the population in question. © The American Ornithologists'

  abstract = {Wildlife managers need to be able to assess density, distribution,
	and status of wildlife populations with reliable techniques. We used
	distance sampling from 971 point transects to estimate density and
	examine herd composition of desert mule deer \textit{(Odocoileus
	hemionus) } on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern
	Arizona during 4 seasons in 1996. We first conducted a pilot study
	to refine survey design and train observers. We also evaluated our
	ability to meet 4 major assumptions of distance sampling (random
	placement of points, objects on points always detected, objects detected
	at initial location, distances measured accurately). Densities varied
	from 0.9 (SE=0.3) deer/km2 in summer to 2.5 (1.3) in winter. Herd
	size varied from 1.5 (0.1) deer/group in summer to 9.7 (2.0) in winter.
	Density of females was greater than males (0.9 [0.3] and 0.03 [0.04],
	respectively) for all seasons combined. We found that placement of
	points, detecting deer at points, and not forcing deer to move from
	their initial location were interrelated and a function of mule deer
	behavior and how we approached points. Our ability to measure distances
	accurately was improved greatly by using distance test courses and
	calibration points throughout the refuge. Important considerations
	in using distance sampling include: 1) careful evaluation of study
	design; 2) establishment of permanent survey points to be used throughout
	time, which aids in field operations and analysis; 3) development
	and use of a distance test course and calibration points to train
	observers, practice measuring distances, and calibrate equipment;
	4) development of standardized protocol to maintain consistent data
	collection among observers and over time; and 5) incorporation of
	a thorough understanding of the target species' behavior and ecology
	into the survey design.},

  abstract = {Hunting is the major driver of large mammal decline in Central African
	forests. In slowly reproducing species even low hunting pressure
	leaves spatial gradients with wildlife density increasing with distance
	from transport routes and human settlements. Park management can
	use this pattern formation to identify sources of threats, but also
	to discriminate between different threat scenarios, such as the impact
	of subsistence vs. commercial hunting. We conducted an ape survey
	in the mountainous Moukalaba Doudou National Park, Gabon, to evaluate
	whether potential population gradients would emanate from the three
	human population centers in the region or the villages surrounding
	the park. Using generalized linear modeling we found hill slope as
	a good predictor of ape nest occurrence probability and the distance
	to human population centers a better predictor of ape nest density
	and ape nest group size than distance to villages. In fact ape nest
	density was three times lower at the park borders close to the human
	population centers than in the park's interior. The results indicate
	that Moukalaba's ape population is more impacted by commercial than
	subsistence hunting and suggest that park management should focus
	conservation efforts on the human population centers. We conclude
	that in particular for slowly reproducing species geographic information
	on wildlife population gradients are of additional value for guiding
	protected area management. The hunting impact on those species might
	be easily underestimated, if derived only from market surveys or
	transport route controls, where they are only rarely found.},

  abstract = {Underwater visual censuses are the most commonly used methods to estimate
	the density of reef fish populations and assemblages. One basic assumption
	is that the observer will always detect fish in the same way from
	one sampling unit to the next, implying that, on average, the spatial
	distribution pattern of fish abundance or occurrence remains the
	same from one transect to the next (H0). The present work tested
	H0 using data from 730 transects covering two regions (New Caledonia
	and French Polynesia), 604 species and 504Â 000 fish. Within transect
	variations in reef fish abundance and occurrence were studied according
	to site factors (region, reef type), life-history traits (adult size,
	home range, schooling behaviour, color, pattern, swimming speed,
	level in the water column, inquisitiveness, crypticity), and observations
	characteristics (distance of observation, size of the observed fishes,
	number of fishes within an observation, observer identity). Two general
	trends were detected: 1 -- at the start of transects, both fish occurrence
	and abundance were higher than the values expected under H0; 2 --
	a similar trend was also observed at the end of transects, but at
	a much lower magnitude. These effects were observed with varying
	degrees of magnitude for all regions, reef types and observers, varied
	significantly according to three life-history traits (size, home
	range, and behaviour), but were not influenced by species richness
	or abundance. These results indicate that datasets gathered from
	transects of various lengths cannot be pooled without correction.
	They also shed light on some of the known differences between transects
	and point counts.},

  review = {Blue whales have two alternating types of vocalizations that are frequently
	heard in our region: the “A” call, which is a pulsed, amplitude-modulated
	signal centered at 16.5 Hz, and a “B” call, which is a down-swept,
	frequency-modulated signal that sweeps from about 18 to 16.5 Hz (Rivers,
	1997).
	
	
	Auto-detection methods detect signals based on how similar they are
	in comparison with a reference signal. The performance of the detector
	is highly dependent on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and how well the
	reference signal matches the data.
	
	
	In the OAO recordings, the strongest component of the “A” call was
	the fourth harmonic, which centered around 90 Hz (Fig. 2). For the
	“B” calls the strongest, most consistently apparent component was
	the second harmonic, centered around 51 Hz (Fig. 2). The detectors
	were designed to exploit these components of the calls, and the frequency
	band spacing allowed for the reduction in the probability of falsely
	classifying by type. The fundamental frequency was not selected due
	to overlapping energies (“A” = 18Hz, “B” = 17Hz) which would increase
	the risk of falsely classifying by type.
	
	
	The false detection rate for this study was set low, 0.3%, to minimize
	error in call counts - which likely means that the probability of
	missing true calls was high!
	
	
	NEED TRANSLATION!: OAO recordings were conditioned before running
	the matched filter detector by band-passed filtering to remove out-of-band
	noise, base-banded, normalized, de-meaned, then down-sampled.
	
	
	To assess the performance of each auto-detection routine, the probability
	of detection was evaluated during all possible noise conditions.
	The effectiveness of detecting blue whale “A” and “B” calls using
	the matched filter detectors was assessed by visually reviewing 48
	hours of data for “A” calls and 120 hours for “B” calls, each containing
	various levels of ambient noise commonly found. Spectrograms (Fast
	Fourier Transform (FFT) with a sample duration of 0.5 – 1.0 seconds,
	a 96% overlap, and a Hanning shading window) of the data were visually
	scanned for the signals. The visual survey provided a ground truth
	to evaluate detector performance. The detectors were scored on the
	number of correct, missed, and false detections.
	
	
	Figure 7. The Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) for both the
	“A” and “B” call detectors. As SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) increased
	so did the probability of detection. A fixed false detection rate,
	p(FD), of 0.3% was selected as the constant, therefore, the probability
	of detection determined by SNR.},

	Ramirez archipelago, Chile, using distance sampling and burrow-scoping},
  journal = {Polar Biology},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {29},
  pages = {229--238},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {The Diego Ramirez Islands lie 60 nautical miles southwest of Cape
	Horn and are the breeding site for three species of burrowing seabirds:
	blue petrels \textit{(Halobaena caerulea)}, common diving petrels
	\textit{(Pelecanoides urinatrix)} and sooty shearwater \textit{(Puffinus
	griseus)}. Burrowing seabirds are highly vulnerable to predation
	by introduced vertebrate pests, and Diego Ramirez is an important
	breeding site because it is one of a few remaining subantarctic island
	groups with no introduced predators. Diego Ramirez is the only known
	breeding site for blue petrels in the southeast Pacific region, holding
	about 80% of the global population of that species, and with a population
	ten times larger than any other population in the world. We estimated
	the population size in 2002, using a novel application of the distance
	sampling technique to determine burrow density, and a burrow-scope
	with excavations to determine occupying species. We found that density
	was correlated with slope angle and soil wetness. Burrow densities
	in flatter terrain with drier soils were 2.03 burrows/m2 (95% confidence
	intervals: 1.82-2.27) and 1.11 burrows/m2 (0.84-1.48) in steeper
	terrain with wetter soils. The occupation rate of burrows were significantly
	different between habitat types (t = 2.74, d.f. 11, P < 0.05); in
	flatter drier habitats the proportion of burrows that led to a nest
	was 0.85 (0.74-0.96), in steeper wetter habitats this decreased to
	0.64 (0.50-0.78). We used a digital elevation model to calculate
	true area rather than planar area for the two habitat types on the
	main island of Bartolome, and charts to calculate planar area for
	the remainder of the archipelago. There were 1.35 (1.15-1.54) million
	pairs of blue petrels and 99,000 (65,000-134,000) pairs of common
	diving petrels on the archipelago. These are similar figures to those
	from the only previous estimate, made in 1980. We found breeding
	sooty shearwaters for the first time, and estimated a population
	of several thousand pairs. We emphasise the facility of distance
	sampling as an unbiased technique with practical advantages over
	commonly used area search methods for monitoring populations of burrowing
	seabirds. These advantages include increased survey efficiency allowing
	a larger sample size for a given effort and a correspondingly tighter
	estimation of density. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

  journal = {Ibis},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {150},
  pages = {315-325},
  abstract = {Although point transect distance sampling methods have become widely
	used in surveys of forest birds, there has been no attempt to tailor
	field methods to maximize the accuracy of abundance estimates by
	minimizing the effects of violations of the method's critical assumptions,
	which are: (1) birds at distance 0 m are detected with certainty,
	(2) birds are detected at their initial location and (3) distances
	to objects are measured accurately. We investigate the effects on
	abundance estimates for Philippine forest birds of varying the count
	period from 2 to 10 min, and of including and excluding a pre-count
	settling down period. Encounter rates were highly sensitive to count
	period length but density estimates from 10-min count periods were,
	on average, only 13% higher than those from 2-min periods, and in
	several cases were actually lower than those from periods of 6-8
	min. This was because birds tended to be recorded at greater distances
	from the recorder as the count period went on, thus â€˜stretching
	outâ€™ detection functions while having little effect on detection
	rates close to the recorder. For some bird groups, including canopy
	frugivores and upperstorey gleaning insectivores, density estimates
	were more than twice as high without than with a settling down period.
	We suggest that movement away from the recorder is more common than
	attraction to the recorder, and that unless pilot studies show otherwise,
	similar studies should not use a settling down period for surveying
	many species. Count periods that maximized probability of bird detection
	close to the central point while minimizing the unwanted effects
	of bird movement during the count period were: 4 min for omnivores,
	6 min for nectarivores and upperstorey gleaning insectivores, 8 min
	for understorey insectivores and canopy frugivores, and a full 10
	min for sallying insectivores, ground-dwellers, carnivores and coucals/koels.
	We use the results to suggest â€˜group-specificâ€™ count period regimes
	that could help maximize the accuracy of density estimates from similar
	studies of tropical forest birds.},

  abstract = {Some odontocetes and bats vary both click intensity and receiver
	
	sensitivity during echolocation, depending on target range. It is
	not known how
	
	this so-called automatic gain control is regulated by the animal.
	The source
	
	level of consecutive echolocation clicks from a harbour porpoise was
	measured
	
	with a hydrophone array while the animal detected an aluminium cylinder
	at 2, 4
	
	or 8 m distance in a go/no-go paradigm. On-axis clicks had source
	levels of
	
	145-174 dB re 1 \mu Pa peak-to-peak. During target-present trials
	the click
	
	trains reached comparable source levels independent of the range to
	the target
	
	after three clicks. After an additional click, the source level was
	reduced for
	
	the 2 and 4 m trials until it equalled the one-way transmission loss.
	During
	
	target-absent trials, the source level remained high throughout the
	entire
	
	click train. Given typical values of harbour porpoise inter-click
	intervals,
	
	the source level reduction commenced within a few 100 ms from the
	first click
	
	in the click train. This may indicate a sub-cortically regulated source

  abstract = {Grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and fragmented,
	but are poorly protected. Commercial afforestation poses a particular
	threat to grassland biodiversity because areas suitable for forestry
	coincide with those supporting the greatest richness of endemic and
	threatened biota. To comply with international forestry standards,
	commercial timber growers leave "ecological networks" of interconnected
	open corridors within plantations: however, the value of these networks
	for conservation is unclear. This study investigated how bird community
	composition, richness and density were influenced by habitat extent,
	connectivity and quality in a grassland ecological network in a forestry
	plantation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed birds and
	measured local vegetation characteristics throughout the network.
	There were at least five open habitat types within the network and
	bird communities responded clearly to differences between these habitats:
	all network communities showed a distinct shift away from those typical
	of control grasslands. There were three distinct groups of species
	in the network: (1) grassland specialists, (2) habitat generalists
	and (3) non-grassland species. Grassland specialists were restricted
	to areas that are burned regularly and to large, contiguous open
	areas or wide grassland corridors. We found no evidence for the importance
	of physical connectivity among open habitats for birds in the study
	area. Instead, it appears that the establishment of so-called ecological
	networks at this scale has created much unsuitable habitat for grassland
	specialist species. We suggest consolidation of open areas and a
	rotational, biennial burning regime as a more appropriate management
	strategy for commercial plantations in these Critically Endangered
	montane grasslands.},

	Rio Tambopata. All five sites consisted of different forest types
	with significantly different habitat components. Three of these sites

	\textit{Bitis nasicornis)} were studied along several transects,
	during both dry and wet seasons, and at different times of day, in
	southern Nigeria (West Africa). Three habitat types were found along
	the various transects (mature rain forest (MF), secondary rain forest
	(SF), swamp forest (SW)). The detection probabilities for these vipers
	were modelled with a set of competing models, and the various models
	were ordered by Akaike Information Criterion procedures. Two classes
	of models were used: the single-season model, and the multi-species
	model. The best models (single-season model) suggested that: for
	the Gaboon viper, habitat types SF and SW were particularly important
	in detecting this species, especially during the rainy season at
	08h00-16h00. For nose-horned vipers, the best models had SW and MF
	as site-covariates. Application of the multi-species model revealed
	that there were different detection functions if both species are
	present at a site, with a 'negative' interaction of occupancy between
	the species. Females and males were similarly detectable in a logistic
	regression model, but feeding status and pregnancy slightly increased
	detection probability in a logistic regression model. Viper density
	was modelled by a DISTANCE sampling procedure. The density of one
	species tended to be inversely correlated to the density of the other,
	suggesting that (1) the rain-forest environment does not support
	abundant populations of both vipers when sympatric, and (2) the two
	Bitis species subtly partition the habitat resources. Copyright ©

  abstract = {Distance sampling techniques were compared to point (variable plot)
	sampling and fixed-radius circular plot sampling for inventory of
	teak \textit{(Tectona grandis)} plantations in Indonesia. n-tree
	distance sampling selects the n trees closest to a sample point located
	in the field. The distance to the nth closest tree is used as a plot
	radius. Two n-tree estimators were compared. Prodan (1968) described
	a technique for n=6, which counts the nth tree as 1/2 for tree counts
	and tree volume (or other tree attributes). Another approach, here
	called 'the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator' uses the bias correction
	factor (n-1)/n. Eberhardt (1967) demonstrated that the (n-1)/n adjusted
	estimator is unbiased for Poisson (random) and negative binomial
	(clumped) spatial distributions. No proof of unbiasedness is known
	for either method in uniform distributions which would be characteristics
	of plantations. n-tree sampling was performed in Indonesian teak
	plantations for values of n ranging from 3 to 10 for both methods.
	At the same locations, point (variable plot) samples with metric
	basal area factors 1 m2 ha-1 tree-1 and 2 m2 ha-1 tree-1 and fixed-radius
	circular plots 0.1 ha in size were installed for comparison with
	the n-tree distance methods. The time required for each sampling
	method was recorded at each field location. For each method, an efficiency
	ratio was calculated as (C(k)/2 x Time(k))/(C(0.1 ha)/2 x Time(0.1
	ha)) where C(k) is the coefficient of variation for method k, Time(k)
	is the average time required for method k, C(0.1 ha) is the coefficient
	of variation for 0.1 ha plots and Time(0.1 ha) is the average time
	required for 0.1 ha plots. The more efficient methods have smaller
	efficiency ratios. According to this criterion, 5-tree distance sampling
	using Prodan's estimator was most efficient of the techniques compared
	that did not show bias for these data. The (n-1)/n adjusted estimator
	showed bias for these trials in teak plantations. This was probably
	due to the uniform spatial distribution characteristics of plantations.
	Point sampling with BAF=1 m2 ha-1 tree-1 and BAF=2 m2 ha-1 tree-1
	and 0.1 ha plot sampling were not as efficient as n-tree sampling
	methods for these trials.},

	current and the seabed topography on preferred prey. Locally, prey
	animals may be concentrated in areas with a northeast aspect, intermediate

  pages = {33--40},
  abstract = {A shipboard cetacean survey was conducted in July/August 1998 within
	an area to the west of Scotland, UK, commonly known as the Atlantic
	Frontier. The aim of the survey was to document the distribution
	and abundance of cetaceans to provide baseline population data for
	an area that is being increasingly explored and developed by oil
	companies. A double platform ‘independent observer’ (IO) method was
	used to estimate the abundance of the Atlantic white-sided dolphin
	(Lagenorhynchus acutus) using standard line-transect and distance
	sampling methodology. Previously, uncorrected Atlantic white-sided
	dolphin abundance was estimated as 27,194 (CV = 0.29) from this survey.
	This paper presents abundance estimates corrected for g(0) < 1 using
	a direct duplicate method. The value of g(0) was estimated to be
	0.61 (CV = 0.09). The abundance in two strata was estimated as 21,371
	(CV = 0.54) to the west of the Outer Hebrides and74,626 (CV = 0.72)
	in the Faroe Shetland Channel. The high CVs are the result of small
	sample sizes, particularly of the duplicate data set. However, the
	abundance estimates represent the first for this species to the northwest
	of Scotland and adds to existing baseline abundance estimates for
	small cetaceans in UK waters. The results could be useful for planning
	future surveys that aim to calculate more precise abundance estimates.
	These results, together with opportunistic sightings data collected
	during other surveys, suggest that the waters to the west of Scotland
	are an important habitat for the Atlantic white-sided dolphin. Presently,
	threats to this species in the area are relatively unknown but a
	baseline population estimate will be an integral part of any management
	regime should there become a need in future.},

	analyses of fish community structure indicated that minnow trap data
	alone provided a better measure of community structure than did distance

	in estimating population density, is hindered by a multitude of environmental
	variables that do not preclude the use of minnow traps. Lakes with

	best suited for distance sampling. Minnow traps proved to be a fast,
	efficacious sampling method capable of fairly accurately defining
	the littoral small-fish community structure in most lakes sampled.
	These traps are a reliable method for monitoring presence or absence
	and relative abundance of small-bodied fish species in north temperate

	operates its biosonar during foraging in the wild. The
	
	process of echolocation during prey capture in this species
	
	can be divided into search, approach and terminal phases,
	
	as in echolocating bats. The approach phase, defined by
	
	the onset of detectable echoes recorded on the tag for click
	
	sequences terminated by a buzz, has interclick intervals
	
	(ICI) of 300–400·ms. These ICIs are more than a

  abstract = {Line transect sampling is one of the most widely used methods for
	animal abundance assessment. Standard estimation methods assume certain
	detection on the transect, no animal movement, and no measurement
	errors. Failure of the assumptions can cause substantial bias. In
	this work, the effect of error measurement on line transect estimators
	is investigated. Based on considerations of the process generating
	the errors, a multiplicative error model is presented and a simple
	way of correcting estimates based on knowledge of the error distribution
	is proposed. Using beta models for the error distribution, the effect
	of errors and of the proposed correction is assessed by simulation.
	Adequate confidence intervals for the corrected estimates are obtained
	using a bootstrap variance estimate for the correction and the delta
	method. As noted by Chen (1998, Biometrics 54, 899-908), even unbiased
	estimators of the distances might lead to biased density estimators,
	depending on the actual error distribution. In contrast with the
	findings of Chen, who used an additive model, unbiased estimation
	of distances, given a multiplicative model, lead to over-estimation
	of density. Some error distributions result in observed distance
	distributions that make efficient estimation impossible, by removing
	the shoulder present in the original detection function. This indicates
	the need to improve field methods to reduce measurement error. An
	application of the new methods to a real data set is presented.},

  abstract = {In comparison with other tropical forest land uses such as selective
	logging, little is known of the impacts on wildlife of the many forms
	of small-scale agriculture practised across the tropics. We present
	density estimates, derived using a point count distance sampling
	method, for 31 bird species in primary forest, old abandoned gardens
	and active/recently abandoned gardens at two altitudes in the Crater
	Mountain Wildlife Management Area (CMWMA), Papua New Guinea. There
	were clear habitat differences between the six habitat/altitude categories,
	with, for example, clines in tree sizes and canopy cover from highest
	values in primary forest to lowest values in current gardens. At
	lower altitudes, primary forest held highest densities of most species,
	whereas at higher altitudes, old abandoned gardens had greater densities
	of many birds, especially insectivores. canoco was used to ordinate
	bird species with respect to major habitat gradient axes. Major axes
	were associated with differences in bird responses to forest conversion
	as well as altitudinal differences in species composition. Most important
	was that several insectivores (especially monarchs, fantails, etc.)
	formed a cluster of species associated with intact, high-biomass
	forest. We suggest that most species reacted moderately to habitat
	changes currently occurring, and this may be due in part to the fact
	that only a small proportion of the landscape at CMWMA has been converted
	to agriculture (around 13% may be current or recently abandoned gardens).
	There were, however, species with comparatively low densities in
	agricultural habitats and these included several insectivores, the
	terrestrial Blue Jewel-babbler Ptilorrhoa caerulescens, and three
	out of four birds of paradise. © 2006 The Authors.},

  abstract = {The suitability of point count distance methods for estimating densities
	of tropical parrots and hornbills was assessed during surveys in
	Indonesia. The methods will perform well, so long as the following
	are considered. (1) Enough bird records must be accumulated to model
	species' detection curves precisely. For some species, around 2000
	point counts may be needed and, in very rare species, the method
	may not be appropriate. Pooling data across habitats, species or
	years may increase precision in cases of small sample size. (2) Point
	counts are likely to be less biased than line transects because bird
	detection rates close to the recorder may be higher and there may
	be less chance of double-counting birds. Distances greater than 400
	m between census points are unnecessary. (3) Count periods lasting
	ten minutes may be needed to ensure that most birds close to the
	recorder are detected. Controlled flushing of concealed birds after
	the main count period may also be appropriate. (4) The best time
	of day for census is the period when bird detectability is high but
	bird mobility low. For many large avian frugivores, this corresponds
	to the period between one hour after dawn and 10.30 h. (5) Records
	of flying birds must be excluded from density calculations. In the
	species studied, between 2% and 20% should be added to density estimates
	to compensate for the exclusion of flying birds.},

	cuniculus} (Linnaeus, 1758) counts carried out in the south of Portugal.
	Counts were carried out in two years using driven line transects,
	and correlated with vegetation type and the variables using generalised
	linear models. The offset was a surveyed area estimated using Distance
	Sampling Theory as a means of correcting for detectability bias.
	More rabbits were observed in dense vegetation during day-time counts
	and in crops during night-time counts, In 1998, day-time counts were
	higher with higher average daily temperatures, whilst the night-time
	counts were higher with higher minimum daily temperatures. In 1999,
	day-time counts decreased with the amount of rainfall in the previous
	month, and the night-time counts decreased with the accumulated rainfall
	in the previous two months and with the higher wind speeds. In order
	to increase efficacy, counts should be carried out either at dawn
	or at dusk during the post-breeding season, and with greater intensity
	in dense scrub or open vegetation with high tree cover. During the
	breeding season and winter, counts should be carried out after dusk
	and with greater intensity in arable crops.},

  review = {Long-duration low-frequency digital recordings are potentially available
	from more than 30 deep ocean hydrophones deployed around the world’s
	oceans by the U.S. military. These hydrophone systems were designed
	either to track Soviet submarines or monitor missile impacts and
	nuclear tests in the central Pacific, but the recordings also contain
	many natural sounds produced by earthquakes, volcanic activity, and
	whales.
	
	
	Estimating absolute abundance directly from acoustic recordings requires
	understanding the acoustic behavior of the whales to a degree beyond
	our present state of knowledge.
	
	
	However, minimum abundance estimates can be derived from an isolated
	hydrophone if the range for each of the calling whales can be accurately
	estimated. Absolute abundance estimates may ultimately be achieved
	by deriving empirical calibrations from acoustic recordings obtained
	from areas where population density is known from visual census efforts.
	
	
	In this paper, a method of population assessment based on acoustic
	techniques is applied to the study of fin whales (B. physalus) using
	a seafloor hydrophone located off the island of Oahu, Hawaii, an
	area where so few fin whales have been seen that their density has
	not been previously estimated (Mobley et al., 1996). Based on acoustic
	data from this one hydrophone, a minimum density estimate of fin
	whales at this site 0.081 animals/1000 km2! during peak season is
	derived. Finally, criteria are proposed by which call abundance at
	a site can be measured to ultimately provide an empirically calibrated
	population density estimate.
	
	
	In contrast to visual fin whale distance sampling data where detection
	rates decrease with range out to a maximum of about 6 km (Clark and
	Fristrup, 1997) because it is more difficult to see more distant
	animals, ocean acoustic data for fin whales from a deepwater hydrophone
	have a relatively constant detection rate out to about 20 km where
	variability in ambient noise levels and in call source levels combine
	to obscure some calls.
	
	
	The most obvious problem with estimating population density using
	single hydrophone data is that if only one point, the hydrophone
	location, is sampled, a few resident whales could produce the vast
	majority of the calls. Multiple hydrophone locations are needed before
	extrapolating such a population density estimate to a much larger
	area.},

	differ in ecological productivity. We then analyzed bird response
	(75 species) at both the species and community level to gradients
	in edge density (m/ha) of open and closed-canopy forest within 1-km
	radius landscapes. We found that (1) differences in vegetation and

	with intermediate levels of productivity; (2) more bird species responded
	to changes in edge density in more productive west-slope Cascade

	for the beaked whales.
	
	
	Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) make excellent subjects for
	acoustic surveys. They are highly vocally active (Jaquet et al. 2001,
	this volume), making them easily detected acoustically, particularly
	during long dives when they are visually undetectable. Their sounds,
	wideband clicks that usually occur in certain timing patterns (Jaquet
	et al. 2001), are distinctive and can be easily distinguished, in
	most cases, from other marine sounds. Their sounds are also easily
	localized, as the clicks have a sharp onset and offset and so provide
	good material for determining the time-ofarrival differences used
	in many acoustic localization methods.
	
	
	If acoustic methods are to be used for population studies, a key question
	is that of acoustic detection distance: at what distance is a given
	species audible? The answer depends on many factors, leading to the
	need for a statistical model that calculates some kind of mean detection
	distance, averaged over the relevant factors.
	
	
	In this paper, we first describe the acoustic monitoring methods used
	on cruises in the GOM. We also develop a method for estimating the
	acoustic detectability of sperm whales. Improvements over previous
	estimation methods include (1) the use of a more realistic acoustic
	model to estimate propagation loss, (2) a statistical model of whale
	diving behavior, and (3) a statistical model of whale sound production
	that includes variable-loudness calls.
	
	
	The model:
	
	
	Under what conditions can a whale be heard? A whale is just detectable
	when
	
	
	ls-t(r,dr,ds)=n-g
	
	
	where
	
	
	ls = source level of whale, dB
	
	t(r,dr,ds) = transmission loss (dB) as a function of range r, depth
	of receiver dr, and depth of source ds
	
	n = noise level, dB
	
	g = processing gain and detection gain, dB},

  abstract = {Quantifying kill rates and sources of variation in kill rates remains
	an important challenge in linking predators to their prey. We address
	current approaches to using global positioning system (GPS)-based
	movement data for quantifying key predation components of large carnivores.
	We review approaches to identify kill sites from GPS movement data
	as a means to estimate kill rates and address advantages of using
	GPS-based data over past approaches. Despite considerable progress,
	modelling the probability that a cluster of GPS points is a kill
	site is no substitute for field visits, but can guide our field efforts.
	Once kill sites are identified, time spent at a kill site (handling
	time) and time between kills (killing time) can be determined. We
	show how statistical models can be used to investigate the influence
	of factors such as animal characteristics (e.g. age, sex, group size)
	and landscape features on either handling time or killing efficiency.
	If we know the prey densities along paths to a kill, we can quantify
	the â€˜attack successâ€™ parameter in functional response models
	directly. Problems remain in incorporating the behavioural complexity
	derived from GPS movement paths into functional response models,
	particularly in multi-prey systems, but we believe that exploring
	the details of GPS movement data has put us on the right path.},

	revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences,
	we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in
	movement models. The way animals move has important consequences
	for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population

  review = {Neste paper usam os 82 hidrofones do AUTEC para estimar a abundância
	de Baleia-bicuda-de-Blainville.
	
	
	Do que percebi da metodologia, procedeu-se assim:
	
	
	1. foram escolhidos 8 periodos de 140 minutos (em 8 dias diferentes
	- de 25-04 a 02-05 de 2005, ou seja, 1 periodo por dia
	
	
	2. em cada periodo de 140 minutos, e com base nos clicks, o numero
	de grupos de animais identificado (este procedimento não é claro,
	subdivisão dos periodos em 14 subperiods de 10 minutos, e depois...????
	- parece muito ad hoc)
	
	
	3. para cada periodo, o numero de animais foi obtido multiplicando
	o numero de grupos por 4.1 (número médio por grupo, obtido na bibliografia)
	
	
	4. a densidade foi obtida pela media dos 8 periodos, e dividindo pela
	área total do AUTEC (1536 km^2)
	
	
	Pormenores:
	
	
	Concluiram que de facto qualquer baleia que fizesse um som a menos
	de 4.8 km de um hidrofone era detectado (4.8 km é um hidrophone baseline...
	mas não sei o que isso é)
	
	
	O tempo maximo entre vocalizações de um grupo é de 140 minutos (base:
	DTAG data), por isso escolheram esse periodo - IMPORTANTE: será que
	se consegue distinguir 2 grupos de 1 grupo que produza som 2 vezes
	em 140 minutos? Aparentemente não... ("It is assumed that detections
	within the maximum hydrophone baseline (4.8 km) belong to the same
	group. This method does not account for groups of animals collocated
	within a hydrophone array. If this occurs, the collocated groups
	are counted as a single group.")
	
	
	Estimação do Cluster size: "Globally M. densirostris group size is
	generally considered to range from one to seven [7]. Hauser noted
	M. densirostris group sizes between 2 and 4 individuals offshore
	central Abaco [8]. Generally, M. densirostris in tropical waters
	have been observed with group sizes from three to seven individuals
	[7]. Claridge (2004) reported group sizes in the Bahamas ranging
	from one to eleven animals with an average group size of 4.1, which
	was used for this analysis [9]."
	
	
	OU SEJA:
	
	
	No fim de contas, parece um procedimento muito ad hoc, e é apenas
	uma densidade média (a média refere-se a uma média no tempo, ao longo
	de 8 dias).
	
	
	
	Questões:
	
	
	1. O que é um hidrophone baseline?
	
	
	2. Dado que os periodos de 140 minutos foram definidos como sendo
	o maximo tempo que uma baleia está sem ser ouvida, e que se 2 grupos
	estiverem no alcance de um mesmo hidrofone que vocalizem no mesmo
	periodo de 140 minutos são contabilizados como um só, parece haver
	aqui 2 vieses em direcções opostas: 2.1 se algumas baleias demorarem
	mais de 140 miutos a vocalizar, podem não ser ouvidas; 2.2 se dois
	grupos de baleias vocalizarem ao mesmo tempo, podem ser contabilizados
	como um grupo apenas.
	
	
	3. Mean cluster size based on 1 study in bibliography
	
	Claridge, D.E., “Fine-scale distribution and habitat selection of
	beaked whales,” MSc Thesis, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK,
	2006.
	
	(same conditions apply? timeo of day? sea state? time of year?). O
	paper reconhece a necessidade de se saber mais sobre isto.
	
	
	4. Podemos mesmo pensar em distance sampling numa situação desta em
	que qualquer animal que produza um som num raio de 4.8 km é detectado
	com certeza?
	
	
	5. Não percebo o algoritmo de contagem de grupos para cada periodo
	de 140 minutos
	
	
	"Once M. densirostris clicks were isolated, 140-minute continuous
	data blocks from 8 different days were analyzed. These included blocks
	recorded both during the day and at night. For each day, the number
	of groups of animals was approximated. This number was multiplied
	by an average group size to derive the number of animals within the
	field of sensors.
	
	
	(ok até aqui)
	
	
	The 140-minute measurement window was divided into 14 10-minute segments.
	
	
	(porquê 10 mins, e quais as implicações de variar estenumero?)
	
	
	For each segment, click count statistics were calculated. The hydrophone
	with the maximum number of clicks (red) and those with clicks 1 and
	2 standard deviations (green, yellow) above the mean were color coded
	and displayed on a range sensor map (Fig. 5). Each 10-minute sequential
	segment was examined to isolate groups of animals. For each cluster
	of hydrophones with beaked whale click counts at least 1 standard
	deviation above the mean, a circle with a radius of 4.8 km was drawn
	around the hydrophone with the maximum click count. This process
	was repeated for phones outside the circles until all phones were
	assigned to groups.
	
	
	(ou isto esta mal descrito, ou tou a perceber mal, ou pode dar barraca
	- ver dezenho no meu caderno)
	
	
	All 14 10-minutes segments were analyzed in a like manner. The active
	hydrophones from each 10-minute segment were overlaid on a range
	plot. A blue circle was used to indicate each group of animals (Fig.
	5)."
	
	
	o que é um active hidrophone (+ de 1 dp de cliks???). como se passa
	dos plots para numero de grupos?
	
	
	6. Qual é a área que se considera amostrada (velho problema com captura
	recaptura).
	
	
	7. Será coincidencia que, dos 8 periodos analizados, os 4 com maiores
	contagens tenham sido de dia e os 4 com menores de noite? Quais as
	implicações. Que densidade estamos a estimar? Faz lembrar as discussões
	em Maryland!},

  abstract = {Chimpanzee \textit{(Pan troglodytes troglodytes)} and western gorilla
	\textit{(Gorilla gorilla gorilla)} populations in central Africa
	are rapidly declining as a result of disease epidemics, commercial
	bushmeat hunting, and habitat destruction. Our main objective was
	to estimate the absolute abundance and habitat utilization of chimpanzees
	and gorillas in the intact forests of the Goualougo Triangle in the
	Republic of Congo, and in an adjacent area in which selective logging
	will take place in the near future. The estimates provide a unique
	baseline for apes inhabiting an undisturbed environment. A second
	objective was to compare estimates of abundance and patterns of habitat
	utilization generated by different techniques: 1) distance sampling
	of individual ape nests and nest sites along line transects, 2) direct
	observations of apes during reconnaissance surveys, and 3) observations
	of ape traces during reconnaissance surveys. We completed a total
	of 222 km of line transect surveys in 4 sampling areas, resulting
	in overall density estimates of 1.53 chimpanzees/km2 and 2.34 gorillas/km2
	from nest sites. We generated a density estimate of 2.23 chimpanzees/km2
	from direct observations during reconnaissance surveys of a semihabituated
	community in 1 of the 4 sampling areas. Habitat use profiles that
	nest surveys depicted on transects differed from those of direct
	observations and traces we encountered on reconnaissance surveys.
	We found the highest overall abundance of chimpanzee nests in monodominant
	Gilbertiodendron forest, whereas our direct observations showed that
	chimpanzees preferred mixed species forest. Transects that traversed
	the core area of the community range had the highest encounter rates
	of chimpanzee nests and nest sites. Gorilla nests on transects showed

  review = {SUMMARY (KIND OF)
	
	This paper presents a method for using wide-baseline acoustic arrays
	for passive marine mammal tracking developed as part of the Marine
	Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges (M3R) project. Spectrogram analysis
	is utilized for click detection, coupled with a pattern matching
	algorithm for aligning click sequences among multiple hydrophones
	and determining time differences of arrivals (TDOAs). A hyperbolic
	positioning algorithm is then used to compute the animal’s location.
	No attempts are made to automatically separate marine mammal vocalizations
	from other noise sources.
	
	
	Marine mammal click localization consists of detection, data association,
	and position determination. Detection is broken into two stages.
	The ?rst stage is an FFT based energy personal detector that produces
	a binary frequency map as its output. The second stage determines
	whether a click is present by examining the frequency map. Detected
	clicks are timealigned to produce a click pattern, or ‘‘click map’’,
	for each hydrophone. An association algorithm correlates click maps
	between several hydrophones and a master in a pair-wise fashion to
	produce time differences of arrivals (TDOAs). Finally, a hyperbolic
	positioning algorithm is applied to determine animal location.
	
	
	CLICK DETECTION
	
	The ?rst stage is implemented using N-point fast Fourier transforms
	(FFTs) with a rectangular window and variable overlap (typically
	50%). For this analysis, an FFT size of 512 points was chosen. Each
	frequency bin of the FFT output is compared to a time varying threshold,
	D(f,t). The threshold is set to be m dB above the (time) average
	power within frequency bin f. For this data set, m was empirically
	chosen as 23 dB above the noise (ARBITRÀRIO), and the time averaging
	window was 21.3 ms.
	
	
	FFT é aplicada, para identificar em cada intervalo de tempo as frequencias
	com maior energia. Para cada intervalo de tempo, há um limite arbitrário,
	que é X acima da média de power que "rodeia" o intervalo tempo que
	esta a ser analisado. Depois, para cada intervalo de tempo, se mais
	de 10 frequencias tiverem acima desta média, considera-se um click.
	
	
	Inter-click interval patterns have been found to be an effective means
	of both differentiating between individual whales and associating
	patterns of detections among hydrophones [23]. A series of clicks
	from a single animal is received on the surrounding hydrophones.
	Diifferent (spatially separated) hydrophones may pick up diifferent
	portions of the emitted click structure, but the inter-click interval
	will be nearly the same on all hydrophones. We assume animals exhibit
	their own unique pattern of clicks, and can thus be separated by
	cross-correlating a series of clicks across multiple hydrophones.
	
	
	CLICK ASSOCIATION
	
	Detected clicks may belong to one or more animals. Conceptually, the
	next step is to cross correlate the click maps from several hydrophones
	with a master hydrophone to align individual click patterns, and
	to ?nd the TDOA between each hydrophone and the master. A click pattern
	unique to an individual will match the same pattern time-delayed
	on a different hydrophone. The time delay is proportional to the
	difference in distance from the animal to the respective hydrophones.
	
	
	COMO SE CONSEGUE ENCONTRAR A SEGUNDA BALEIA; SE A PRIMEIRA TIVER TIPO
	50 CLICKS ALINHADOS E A SEGUND SÒ 10??????????
	
	
	For this data set, arrays are de?ned with four slave hydrophones surrounding
	a center master hydrophone. The click map on the master channel is
	used as a template by the scanning sieve. The master template is
	compared against the click map for each hydrophone in the array.
	The scanning sieve starts on a click detection on the master template.
	The selected slave click map is shifted across the master template
	one click at a time. The resultant correlation value at each shift
	of the slave click map represents the number of matches between the
	master template and the slave. The delay corresponding to the maximum
	correlation value between the master and a speci?ed slave represents
	the difference in time of arrival (TDOA) between the two sensors.
	The output of the scanning sieve process are sets of TDOAs between
	the master and each hydrophone in the array. The master template
	is then shifted to the next click and the entire process is repeated.
	
	
	To de-noise the TDOAs, the TDOA data from each hydrophone pair (master,
	slave) are histogrammed. Histograms are typically computed over a
	window of approximately 5 min. Signi?cant TDOA groups are determined
	by thresholding the histograms. For this data set, the threshold
	is set to a value three times the mean, which has been empirically
	found to be effective on previous data sets (ARBITRÀRIO). TDOA groups
	that pass threshold are sent to a multilateration localization algorithm
	that calculates a 2D or 3D position. More than one signi?cant TDOA
	group may be present in the histogram. Each signi?cant TDOA group
	is associated with a single animal, a co-located group of animals,
	or a reverb from another TDOA group. Histogramming the data from
	hydrophone pair G[7] and I[9], indicated in green in Fig. 7, yields
	the plot shown in Fig. 8.
	
	
	LOCALIZATION
	
	Positions are computed from the output of the click association sieve
	using a hyperbolic multilateration positioning algorithm developed
	by Vincent [24]. A representative sound speed pro?le is required.
	TDOAs are required between at least three hydrophones and the master
	in order to compute a 3D position. If less than four hydrophones
	are available, a 2D position is computed by ?xing the depth at 0.
	
	
	CONCLUSON (KIND OF - for multiple animals)
	
	But regarding the multiple whales data set, the results were somewhat
	dismaying right?
	
	
	Processing the raw acoustic data yielded 84 distinct positions within
	five nmi of the closest array master, 20 of which were 3D, and the
	rest 2D. These positions are shown in Figs. 9 and 10.

	1. area effectivelly covered
	
	2. how many animals},

	of white-tailed deer \textit{(Odocoileus virginianus)} has been much
	debated, but few data are available on field applications and even
	fewer on population effects. Between 1993 and 1997, 74-164 individually
	known female deer living on Fire Island, New York, USA, were treated
	remotely with an initial shot of 65 microg porcine zona pellucida
	(PZP) in Freund's complete adjuvant followed by booster injections
	of 65 microg PZP in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Starting in 1996,
	progressively increasing numbers of deer were treated with vaccinating/marking
	darts. Estimates of population density and composition, using distance
	sampling methods, began in 1995 in selected portions of the study
	area. Between 1993 and 1997, fawning rates among individually known,
	treated adult females decreased by 78.9% from pretreatment rates.
	Population density in the most heavily treated area increased by
	11% per year from 1995 to March 1998 and then decreased at 23% per
	year to October 2000. In 1999-2000 surveys, fawns comprised 13-14%
	of the total population in the most heavily treated area, versus
	16-33% in nearby untreated areas. These results show that PZP can
	be delivered effectively to sufficient deer to affect population
	density and composition in some environments, but that technical
	and logistical improvements are needed before contraception can be
	used widely to manage suburban deer populations.},

  abstract = {We evaluated distance sampling and dung plots as cost-effective methods
	of estimating the density of mountain hares \textit{Lepus timidus}
	on moorland in the Scottish Highlands. We compared density estimates
	derived from these techniques to those derived from labour-intensive
	capture-recapture techniques. Distance sampling and capture-recapture
	techniques produced comparable density estimates at medium and low
	hare densities. Density estimates derived from distance sampling
	were higher than those derived from capture-recapture in high-density
	hare populations. Both distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques
	gave wide confidence intervals at high hare density. Histograms of
	perpendicular sighting distances showed that a large proportion of
	hares were seen on or close to the transect line and that there was
	a rapid fall off in detection rates with distance. This finding indicated
	that hare behaviour may lead to problematic survey design and may
	reduce the precision of density estimates. The collection of accurate
	distance sampling data was particularly problematic when hare density
	was high. In contrast, in low-density hare populations, considerable
	sampling effort was required to obtain sufficient sightings of hares
	to reliably estimate density. Dung plots provided a relative index
	of abundance that successfully ranked populations of mountain hares
	in order of increasing density as determined by distance sampling
	and capture-recapture techniques. With careful study design, distance
	sampling provides a good compromise between accuracy, precision and
	effort in estimating the density of mountain hares. The use of dung
	plots is a rapid alternative when only estimates of relative abundance
	are required.},

  journal = {Bird Study},

  volume = {52},
  pages = {42--54},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Capsule: The BBS has potential for producing better estimates of habitat-specific
	densities and population sizes for many UK bird populations than
	those available previously. Aims: To examine the use of the Breeding
	Bird Survey (BBS) in providing unbiased national population and habitat-specific
	density estimates of British birds. Methods: Line transect data collected
	by volunteers in 1998 from 2287 1-km squares across the UK were analysed
	using distance sampling methods to calculate habitat-specific density
	and abundance estimates. For each species, the habitat-specific decline
	in detectability with distance from a transect line was modelled
	and applied at a regional level to incorporate variation in sampling
	intensity in different areas of the country. Results: National population
	and density estimates calculated here were at a magnitude expected
	for at least seven species in this study. However, national population
	size estimates were higher than expected for Starling \textit{Sturnus
	vulgaris}, House Sparrow \textit{Passer domesticus}, Blackbird \textit{Turdus
	merula}, Greenfinch \textit{Carduelis chloris}, Jackdaw \textit{Corvus
	monedula}, Whitethroat \textit{Sylvia communis}, Woodpigeon \textit{Columba
	palumbus} and Linnet \textit{Carduelis cannabina} and lower than
	expected for Skylark \textit{Alauda arvensis}, Dunnock \textit{Prunella
	modularis}, Song Thrush \textit{Turdus philomelos} and Corn Bunting
	\textit{Miliaria calandra}. These differences are likely to be related
	to differences in sampling design and survey methods. For example,
	Starling, House Sparrow, Blackbird, Jackdaw, Greenfinch and Wood
	Pigeon, which have considerable populations in urban areas, were
	undoubtedly underestimated by the Common Birds Census (CBC). The
	counts of species that flock during the breeding season, or are not
	strongly territorial (e.g. Linnet, Jackdaw and Wood Pigeon) could
	be biased if detectability is strongly related to flock size. National
	population estimates of Skylark and Corn Bunting are lower than those
	based on CBC, but higher, or similar, to targeted national surveys
	of these species. Possible reasons for the differences between these
	estimates are considered. Conclusions: This study highlights the
	strength of the BBS over previous data sources in producing national
	estimates of density and abundance at the habitat and national level.
	More research on the sex ratio and status of birds counted during
	surveys, and on the reliability of the detectability functions derived
	from distance sampling is needed to improve the interpretation of
	population estimates derived from BBS data. © 2005 British Trust

  review = {As they are the predominant vocalization present in the recordings,
	this work concentrates on the so-called regular (or usual) clicks
	emitted by sperm whales during deep dives [1]. Regular clicks have
	inter-click intervals (ICIs) of 0.5–2 s [2,3], duration of about
	10–20 ms [2], and energy from below 100 Hz to above 20 kHz [4,5].
	Due to these characteristics, as well as the deep-water environment
	and bottom-mounted hydrophones used for the recordings, direct and
	surface-reflected arrivals can be easily identified. Specifically,
	reflected arrivals come shortly after their associated direct arrivals
	and they have lower amplitude, less power at high frequencies, and
	slightly longer duration. Moreover, the effect of source-receiver
	spacing on the time delay between corresponding direct and surface-reflected
	rays (DRTD) is clearly audible; DRTDs decrease with increasing source/receiver
	separation. (O QUE FAZ SENTIDO, POIS SE FONTE E DETECTOR ESTIVEREM
	MUITO PROXIMOS A DISTÂNCIA ATE A SUPERFICIE É RELATIVAMENTE GRANDE,
	MAS SE ESTIVEREM MUITO AFASTADOS, AS DISTANCIAS DIRECTA E PELA SUPERFICIE
	CONVERGEM PARA SER IGUAIS) For a moving sperm whale DRTDs vary between
	receivers as well as with time on a single receiver.
	
	
	Method Overview (at least four receivers are required for the localizations):
	
	
	 Signals are sub-divided into short time intervals, (SENDO ESTIMADA
	UMA LOCALIZAÇÃO PARA CADA INTERVALO DE TEMPO) and a list of candidate
	source depths is created. For each time interval and depth processed
	separately:
	
	
	1. At each receiver, the DRTD is established by a click detection
	scheme. These measured DRTDs are compared to modeled DRTDs to estimate
	the horizontal separation of source and receiver. This separation
	defines (the radius of) a circle centered at the receiver. If the
	search has been conducted at the correct source depth, the arrival
	times have been accurately determined, and the environment has been
	perfectly modeled, all receiver circles intersect at a single point,
	which is the position of the source.
	
	
	2. In most cases, however, the circles do not intersect at a single
	point, and a point of best agreement must be determined. This is
	accomplished by creating a likelihood surface (a probabilistic indicator
	of source location sometimes referred to as an ambiguity surface)
	for each receiver; the surfaces are assigned value 1 along the circles
	(highest probability) and decay according to a Gaussian weighting
	away from the circle, both inward and outward. Likelihood surfaces
	for each receiver are averaged to create a total likelihood surface
	at the current search depth.
	
	
	This process is repeated for all candidate source depths, and the
	point with maximum likelihood is declared the overall estimated source
	position at that time. Only positions at times that give sufficiently
	large likelihood are retained.

  abstract = {Effective management and conservation of wildlife populations require
	reliable estimates of population size, which can be difficult and
	costly to obtain. We evaluated how precision in estimates of herd
	size and abundance varies with sample size and strip width using
	two field surveys and bootstrap resampling of the field data. We
	also examined precision under distance sampling and evaluated the
	cost-effectiveness of both survey techniques. Precision in estimates
	of abundance increased with increasing sample size and varied with
	strip width independently of sample size. The hazard rate key function
	was best for five species in two surveys with contrasting visibility
	conditions. Precision in density was more sensitive to the number
	of herds sighted than to variation in herd size and effective strip
	width for distance sampling. Strip counts produced lower abundance
	estimates but higher precision than distance sampling. We estimated
	that distance sampling would cost about US$3.1 km-1 of transect.
	Strip counts deserve serious consideration for surveys of species
	that occur at high densities and form large, loose agglomerations
	but distance methods are suitable for species occurring at moderate
	to low densities in areas where visibility varies substantially.
	Distance sampling may thus need to be supplemented by strip counts
	to efficiently estimate densities of rare, abundant and highly clustered
	multi-species assemblages of African savanna mammals. In small areas,
	it may often prove necessary to conduct several surveys to obtain
	adequate sample sizes for distance models. © 2006 The Authors.},

	conflicts that often threaten the future viability of carnivore populations
	in the pastoral systems of Africa. A playback survey of lions Panthera
	leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta and black-backed jackals Canis
	mesomelas and a transect count of wild herbivores was conducted in
	the Maasai Mara National Reserve and adjoining pastoral ranches to
	assess the effect of pastoralism and protection on the density and
	distribution of carnivores in June 2003. Reliability of the prey
	counts depended on an assumption of similar observability between
	the protected and pastoral areas, which we assessed using distance
	sampling in November 2003 and computer simulations and determined
	to be similar. Estimates of wild prey biomass density was 2.6 times
	higher in the ranches (14212 kg/km2) than in the reserve (5472 kg/km2)
	during this wet season count. Apparent hyena density estimates were
	1.3 times higher in the ranches (0.561 hyenas/km2) than in the reserve
	(0.404 hyenas/km 2), in correspondence with the regional pattern
	of prey density. This distribution of hyenas is biased towards the
	reserve, if it is dependent on prey density. Estimates of apparent
	jackal density were similar in both areas whereas lion density was
	anomalously 8.0 times lower in the ranches (0.046 lions/km2) than
	in the reserve (0.369 lions/km2). Lion and hyena densities and prey
	biomass did not differ between June 1991 (5172.273 kg/km2) and June
	2003 (5472 kg/km2) in the reserve, but jackal density increased in
	the same period. Lions never responded to playbacks in the ranches,
	so the potential shift in lion behavioural response for different
	land use zones is another potential explanation for the patterns
	found here. We think a real shift in lion populations is a better
	explanation than a behavioural change in relation to playbacks based
	on additional data from independent systematic and intensive censuses
	and playback surveys conducted in the ranches. Lion populations in
	the pastoral ranches seemed headed for extinction, probably owing
	to conflicts with pastoralism, necessitating urgent conservation
	interventions that integrate pastoral economic welfare with large
	carnivore conservation goals to foster long-term viability of lion
	populations in the pastoral systems. © 2005 The Zoological Society

	changes. The current study therefore aims to (1) compare population
	size with those of 1986 and (2) employ distance sampling methods
	(not used in 1986) to obtain estimates of population density and
	size. Eighteen transects (13 repeated from the 1986 survey and five
	new) were conducted in the four main areas of laurel forest. Pigeon
	numbers had increased on nearly all transects but some of the highest
	increases, proportionately and often numerically, were in areas with
	lower numbers in 1986. We estimate the current population to be 10,400
	individuals, a considerable increase since 1986, probably due to
	a ban on hunting. As laurel forest habitat is now very well protected
	the Madeira Laurel Pigeon is relatively safe from extinction.},

	Asia. Its actual population size, however, is still disputed, and
	we therefore estimated its numbers in an 80,000 km2 area in the eastern
	steppe of Mongolia by driving long-distance (1,200-1,400 km) transect
	surveys during spring and autumn 2000-2002. Quantitative estimates
	of gazelle numbers are essential for understanding the causes of
	changes in the population, and thus devising conservation strategies
	to assure its long-term viability. Observed herds ranged in size
	from 1-4,000; among surveys, median herd sizes varied from 14-42.
	Density estimates varied from 10.7 gazelles km-2 in spring to 11.5
	gazelles km-2 in autumn, with total population estimates of 803,820
	(483,790-1,330,100 95% confidence interval) and 870,625 (499,432-1,491,278
	95% confidence interval), respectively. Confidence limits were wide,
	and to obtain a coefficient of variation of 20%, transect lengths
	would need to be extended three- to four-fold. Until more efficient
	means for conducting population surveys can be implemented, driving
	long-distance transects, combined with distance analysis, seem to
	provide the best quantitative estimate of Mongolian gazelle populations.

	Several methods exist to quantify odonate abundance, but complications
	may arise when abundances in different habitats need to be compared.
	In this study, I explored a technique that can overcome the variable
	detectability of odonates in habitats with different visibility.
	Distance sampling is briefly introduced and the main assumptions
	are listed. I conducted line transect surveys using distance sampling
	protocol over several weeks in a rainforest locality in Papua New
	Guinea to assess the usefulness of distance sampling. The results
	suggested that estimates of encounter rate and density of odonates
	are substantially higher when distance sampling is employed. Density
	in habitats with poor visibility, like the forest interior, is severely
	underestimated
	
	 by traditional sampling methods, and this can lead to a misclassification
	of habitats. Distance sampling is a very useful technique for quantitative
	odonate sampling, but the sampling effort required for precise estimates
	is very high. For the rainforest locality in this study at least
	15 months of intensive sampling would be required. Further limitations
	of distance sampling are discussed.},

  review = {1. The CV that he hopes to achieve is not only unrealistic but also
	misleading. Take a look at the attached file, if you paste it all
	into R it will show up plots of effort needed as a function of cv
	desired, and how something like e.g. cv 15% (still quite ambitious
	for usual wildlife abundance assessment) would reduce considerably
	the amount of effort needed. BTW, his numbers are correct, though
	the formula presented isn't: (L/n) should be used instead of (n/L).
	It is very annoying that both in the abstract and the discussion
	he states stuff like "For the rainforest locality in this study at
	least 15 months of intensive sampling would be required." without
	acknowledging that no one would realistically expect to achieve a
	5% CV.
	
	
	 NOTE:In the file oppel.R - in the pdf folder - are some commands
	that redo his calculations on effort for a given CV, showing that
	he chose very badly the CV to achieve.
	
	
	 2. I find very very strange that he keeps saying that the encounter
	rate estimated by distance is much larger than the one conventional
	methods produce - what is the encounter rate estimated by distance
	? How can it be different?
	
	
	 3. The sentence "...ESW, defined as the width of the transect where
	all individuals are discovered..." is wrong, awkward and potential
	dangerous
	
	
	 4. "...habitats. It remains to be shown whether distance sampling
	is a robust technique that can overcome heterogenous distribution
	of objects within sampling units (Barry & Welsh 2001; Welsh 2002)...".
	I dislike this sentence, becase it ignores that it's fine if you
	have very heterogenous distribution of objects for each given line,
	say from very clustered populations, provided you have many random
	lines and on average over all lines a uniform dist arises.
	
	
	 5. I missed the point of "...Violation of a key assumption of distance
	sampling would lead to high bias, potentially overestimating odonate
	densities in the habitats under study...". It does depend on the
	assumption...},

	resources that are fixed in space but seasonally variable in availability
	and nutritional value. The concept of intermittent movement leads
	to the recognition of distinct movement modes over a hierarchy of
	spatio-temporal scales. Over larger scales, periods with relatively
	low displacement may indicate settlement within foraging areas, habitat
	units or seasonal ranges. Directed movements connect these patches
	or places used for other activities. Selection is expressed by switches
	in movement mode and the intensity of utilization by the settlement
	period relative to the area covered. The type of benefit obtained
	during settlement periods may be inferred from movement patterns,
	local environmental features, or the diel activity schedule. Rates
	of movement indicate changing costs in time and energy over the seasonal
	cycle, between years and among regions. GPS telemetry potentially
	enables large-scale movement responses to changing environmental
	conditions to be linked to population performance.},

	population numbers nearly 50 000, distributed in more than 50 nuclei,
	and has generally increased during the last decades. Nevertheless,
	within this wider context, different conditions apply to different
	populations, including recent extinction (the Pyrenean population),
	recovery from recent severe epizooty of sarcoptic mange (e.g. the
	Sierras de Cazorla and Segura y Las Villas range population) and
	populations at high densities (e.g. Gredos mountain range and Sierra
	de Grazalema Natural Park, among others). The main factors affecting
	the conservation of this species are also reported and discussed.
	On the basis of current information we propose the status of 'vulnerable'
	for the Spanish Ibex.},

  abstract = {Accurate assesment of the populations of mountain ungulates is difficult.
	Topography and behaviour of animals are important factors influencing
	detectability, on which direct methods are based. Sympathry with
	other wild and domestic ungulates increases error of dung identification.
	Other factors, such as the size of the area to be surveyed, or unmarked
	populations of the target species, suggests the choice of curvilinear
	transects. If the basic assumptions of Distance Sampling methodology
	are met, then estimates of population density and accuracy can be
	obtained. Current technology (GPS, laser rangefinders, and G.I.S.)
	can be used to achieve accurate measurements of distances and angles.
	A crucial problem is to estimate the effective area sampled around
	each travelling path. Therefore, researchers and managers of mountain
	ungulates need an adaptation of Distance Sampling methodology to
	account for a tridimensional scenario imposed by the slope of mountains.
	There is also a requirement to standardize protocols for collecting
	data. Alternatives for design surveys and collection data when working
	with populations of mountain ungulates are discussed.},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {117},
  pages = {15--22},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {As human disturbance of natural landscapes increases, so does the
	need for information on declining, threatened, and potentially threatened
	native species. Proposed listing of the Mountain Plover \textit{(Charadrius
	montanus)} as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in
	1999 was found unwarranted in 2003, but this species remains of special
	concern to management agencies and conservation groups. Whereas large
	concentrations of breeding Mountain Plovers occur in Montana and
	Colorado, estimates of the numbers of Mountain Plovers in Wyoming
	have ranged from only 500 to 1,500 individuals and are based largely
	on conjecture. In 2002, we visited all known breeding locales in
	the state to define areas of concentrated sightings in the Laramie,
	Shirley, Washakie, Great Divide, and Big Horn basins. In 2003, we
	used distance sampling to estimate breeding bird densities in these
	five areas. We pooled these estimates and applied the resulting density
	to a minimum occupied range for the Mountain Plover based on the
	documented sightings and a previously derived home-range size of
	56.6 ha ± 21.5 (SD) to generate a minimum population estimate for
	the state. Average Mountain Plover density was 4.47 ± 0.55 (SE) birds/km2.
	We calculated a minimum population estimate of 3,393 birds for Wyoming.
	The Mountain Plover population breeding in Wyoming appears to contribute
	substantially to a revised continental population estimate of 11,000
	to 14,000 birds. Our approach may have applications to quantifying
	minimum population status of other uncommon species or species of
	special conservation concern using current database records, such
	as those compiled in Natural Heritage Programs at the state level.},

  abstract = {Understanding butterfly response to landscape context can inform conservation
	management and planning. We tested whether local-scale resources
	(host and nectar plants, canopy cover) or landscape context, measured
	at two scales, better explained the densities of four butterfly species.
	The density of Coenonympha tullia, which has host plants strongly
	associated with grassland habitats, was positively correlated with
	the amount of grassland in 0.5- and 1-km radius landscapes and only
	occurred in forests when they bordered grasslands. For the other
	species, Celastrina ladon, Cupido amyntula, and Vanessa cardui, local-scale
	resources better explained butterfly densities, emphasizing the importance
	of local habitat quality for butterflies. These three species also
	used host plants that were distributed more heterogeneously within
	and among habitat types. Our findings demonstrate the importance
	of host plant spatial distributions when determining the scale at
	which butterfly density relates to resources, and we recommend that
	both these distributions and landscape context be evaluated when
	developing butterfly monitoring programs, managing for species of
	concern, or modeling potential habitat},

	a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning

	populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge {(PNWR)} in
	Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates,
	and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry,
	and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities
	{(P} = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10
	ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4
	years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 Â± 0.014 {(SE)} for females
	(n = 63) and 0.976 Â± 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual
	adult survival was 0.579 {(SE} = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed
	burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding
	season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth
	(Î») at {PNWR} was 1.00 (95\% confidence interval {[CI]} = 0.32-1.63),
	and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the
	need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants.
	Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the
	burn and thin (95\% {CI} before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05),
	while control compartment Î» declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after
	= 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime

  abstract = { Summary 1. Non-invasive genetic data analysed with capture-mark-recapture
	(CMR) models can be used to estimate population size, particularly
	for elusive and endangered species. Data generated from non-invasive
	genetic sampling are different, however, from conventional CMR data
	because individuals can be contacted several times within a single
	sampling session. Two methods have been proposed recently to accommodate
	this type of data, but no study has attempted to compare their estimates
	and evaluate their reliability compared with independent estimates
	of population size. 2. We investigated the reliability and accuracy
	of estimating the abundance of lesser horseshoe bats Rhinolophus
	hipposideros by genotyping DNA from droppings collected non-invasively
	at three colonies over 2 consecutive years. The number of times that
	each individual was 'contacted' (i.e. the number of droppings per
	individual) was used to estimate population size with two different
	published methods: a maximum likelihood and a Bayesian estimator.
	3. Among the 586 samples extracted, 534 provided a complete genotype
	at six to eight microsatellite loci, which enabled a reliable discrimination
	of 165 individuals. Statistical estimates of colony sizes often included
	independent estimates obtained from visual counts, validating the
	method. Discrepancies appeared when capture heterogeneity was not
	taken into account while it occurred. 4. Synthesis and applications.
	We have taken a first step towards improving methods of estimating
	numbers of bats by demonstrating that genetic data produced from
	bat faecal DNA are of high quality and can provide accurate estimates
	of population size even when samples are taken during only one sampling
	session. Such protocols provide valuable management tools for elusive
	and rare species in general. The method is relatively easy and cost-efficient
	because only one sampling session is required. Journal of Applied

  abstract = {The theory underlying line transect and variable circular plot surveys-distance
	sampling-begins with an assumed detectability function, giving the
	probabilities of detecting animals at different distances from the
	observer's path. The nature of these probabilities is unspecified
	in the general development, leaving users to question whether the
	actual probability structure matters. In particular, may one use
	the methodology in surveys where animals at the same distance have
	different probabilities of detection? This paper presents three examples
	where probabilities come from different assumptions: from the random
	placement of transects; from the uniform distribution of animals
	over the study region; and from cues randomly detected by the observer.
	These exemplify situations where detectability may not be a function
	of distance alone. Horvitz-Thompson estimators are displayed which
	can be used in each example, but some estimators require measuring
	features other than distance. A result concerning optimally weighted
	Horvitz-Thompson estimators shows that all three can be brought under
	the same umbrella if detection areas are measured instead of detection
	distances and if animals are uniformly distributed. © 2004 Kluwer

	a rare species in Hawaiian waters due to limited sightings during
	visual and aerial surveys. However, our research suggests that they
	are more common than previously considered. In spring 2005, a combined
	visual-acoustic survey of cetaceans in Hawaiian waters resulted in
	the sighting of a minke whale within 22 km of Kaua‘i. Minke whale
	vocalizations were also detected at several other locations near
	Kaua‘i and O‘ahu. These 2005 reports are the first from nearshore
	(< 50 km) Hawaiian waters despite years of previous shipboard and
	aerial surveys. The lack of historical sightings is likely due to
	misidentification or the inability to detect these animals during
	poor sighting conditions. We recommend that future cetacean surveys
	in Hawaiian waters include a passive acoustic component to increase
	the likelihood of detecting minke whales.},

	off the eastern coast of the United States nearly emptied of ships
	and, consequently, of the underwater noise pollution the ships generate,
	thus opening the opportunity for a unique scientific study of how
	marine mammals are affected by the noise. By comparing the stress
	on North Atlantic right whales caused by underwater noise pollution
	from commercial shipping before and after September 11, scientists
	were able to demonstrate the significant adverse impact of shipping
	noise on these critically endangered marine mammals. The findings
	add to a growing body of literature that provides the scientific
	basis for emerging global efforts to regulate underwater noise pollution
	and manage its impact on the great whales. The International Maritime
	Organization is the primary global agency with the authority to regulate
	most other pollutants that are discharged from commercial vessels
	and could therefore regulate underwater noise as a new category of
	pollutant. Alternatively, other international treaties and regional
	agreements offer persuasive authority for a new convention dedicated
	to managing all types of underwater noise, including the noise from
	shipping activities. Whether through a new convention or revised
	regulations under the International Maritime Organization, the issue
	is urgent and requires action now by the international community.},

	distance sampling unit (EDSU) and regional levels. The school level
	parameters, which are mainly derived from the image analysis, fall
	into four main categories: positional, morphometric, energetic and
	environmental. At the sampling unit level (i.e. standard integration
	units, commonly 1 or 2.5 nautical miles), parameters used include:
	school structures, protocols for including layers and general scatter
	plus ancillary (e.g. environmental) variables. These variables are
	derived mostly from visual examination of the echogram and from ancillary
	data collected underway. Regional level parameters include those
	mapped from point samples (e.g. trawls) or which are available as
	maps. Each school thus has its own unique parameters and is associated
	with an EDSU and through that to regional data. We discuss the application
	of such databases to the analysis of echo surveys at a school level
	in relation to aggregation patterns (school, school cluster and population)
	and to changes in those aggregation patterns with stock biomass and
	exploitation pattern. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	in the semi-natural zone than the urban zone but abundance was significantly
	lower in semi-natural than urban. The increase in abundance was mainly
	as a result of alien species with the three most abundant species
	in the urban zone being all alien. Semi-natural contained fewer alien
	species than urban and significantly fewer than suburban. The Common
	Myna Acridotheres tristis was the only alien species that was observed
	in all three urbanization zones and was the second most abundant
	species in the suburban and urban zones. Our study supports the process
	of biotic homogenization, where an increase in alien species occurs
	in the urban compared to semi-natural zone. Although the suburban
	zone made an important contribution towards native bird abundance
	in a larger city environment, this environment was also an important

	sciences. We collected published <I>P</I>-values from three leading
	journals, and summarized their distribution using the frequencies
	falling across and within these four threshold values between 0.05

	null models which allowed us to predict the expected proportions

	interval (i.e. those lying below, as opposed to above, each <I>P</I>-value
	threshold). Statistical comparison of these predicted proportions,
	against those actually observed, provides the first empirical evidence
	for a remarkable excess of probability values being cited on, or
	just below, each threshold relative to the smoothed theoretical distributions.
	The pattern is consistent across thresholds and journals, and for
	whichever theoretical approach used to generate our expected proportions.
	We discuss this novel finding and its implications for solving the

  abstract = {Pesticides caused high mortality of birds in agro-ecosystems of Argentina's
	Pampas region during 1995-2003. As part of a program to monitor mortality
	events, we trained observers in distance sampling methods, conducted
	field trials under simulated conditions to assess the degree to which
	the critical assumptions of line-transect surveys were met, and estimated
	the density and number of chicken carcasses randomly placed along
	fixed transects in corn stubble, corn, alfalfa, wheat, pasture, and
	forest. The assumption of 100% detection probability of carcasses
	at 0 distance was met. We measured cluster size (1-5 carcasses) exactly
	and measured perpendicular distance from a cluster to transect centerline
	(0-40 m) with little error (absolute difference between actual and
	measured distances: x? = 0.14 m, SE = 0.01, n = 121). Cluster detection
	was not size-biased in corn stubble but was size-biased in corn,
	alfalfa, wheat, pasture, forest, and all strata combined. Thirteen
	3-observer teams performed equally well in field trials regardless
	of having or not having observers with previous experience conducting
	transect surveys of bird carcasses in agro-ecosystems. Teams with
	experienced and inexperienced observers missed clusters near the
	centerline (defined here as 1.5-5 m for wheat and 5-15 m for other
	strata) but detected all clusters on the centerline (defined here
	as 0-1.5 m for wheat and 0-5 m for other strata). Percent relative
	bias was 0.36% for corn stubble (n = 39); 5.63% for the combined
	data of corn, alfalfa, wheat, pasture, and forest (n = 73); and 0.51%
	for all strata (n = 121). Bias estimates were small in relation to
	standard errors of density estimates, and the density estimator produced
	95% confidence intervals that always included true densities. Predators
	and scavengers started removing carcasses during the first day of
	exposure (cumulative survival: x? = 0.69, SE = 0.04, n = 36) and
	stopped removing them after day 5 (cumulative survival: x? = 0.04,
	SE = 0.02, n = 5). Carcass removal rate averaged -0.38/day (SE =
	0.03). Although line-transect sampling represents a viable method
	to estimate the density and number of dead birds in agro-ecosystems,
	scavenging data should be collected to adjust these estimates, even
	when surveys are conducted the day following pesticide application.
	An effective communication network between collaborators and the
	general public and observer readiness are needed as part of research
	and monitoring efforts to guide decision-making on agricultural practices,
	promote law enforcement, and manage wildlife in agro-ecosystems.},

  year = {2006},
  volume = {77},
  pages = {46--60},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Although investigators have evaluated the efficacy of survey methods
	for assessing densities of breeding birds, few comparisons have been
	made of survey methods for wintering birds, especially in grasslands.
	In winter, social behavior and spatial distributions often differ
	from those in the breeding season. We evaluated the degree of correspondence
	between density estimates based on different survey methods. Surveys
	were conducted during two winters (2001-2002 and 2002-2003) on 16
	grassland sites in southwestern Oklahoma. Line-transect (using a
	detection function to account for birds present but not detected)
	and area-search (where density was based on the total count within
	a given area) methods were employed. Observations on line transects
	were also analyzed as strip transects, where density was based on
	total count within a given strip width and no detection function
	was used. Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), LeConte's
	Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia),
	Smith's Longspurs (Calcarius pictus), Chestnut-collared Longspurs
	(C. ornatus), and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were sufficiently
	abundant to allow comparison. Area-search density estimates tended
	to be higher than line-transect estimates for Savannah Sparrows,
	Song Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks, suggesting that some individuals
	initially located close to the transect line were not detected on
	line transects. The area-search and line-transect methods gave similar
	density estimates for Chestnut-collared and Smith's longspurs. Area-search
	estimates of Eastern Meadowlarks were significantly higher in the
	second year of the study only. For this species, area-search estimates
	did not differ from those of strip transects covering an equal area,
	so the reason for the differing meadowlark estimates is not clear.
	Higher density estimates using the area-search method likely resulted
	from: (1) birds that might escape detection by hiding were more likely
	detected (flushed) during area searches because of the repeated passes
	through the area, and (2) birds close to the line in line transects
	escape detection by hiding, biasing those estimates low. We also
	evaluated the correspondence of density rankings for the six species
	as determined by the different survey methods and for the same species
	across survey sites. Correlations among the six species of the area-search
	results with those of line transects and strip transects generally
	were high, increasing in 2002-2003 when densities of birds were greater.
	All three methods provided similar density rankings among species.
	Density rankings within species across sites for the four non-longspur
	species generally were concordant for the three methods, suggesting
	that any of them will adequately reflect among-site differences,
	especially when densities vary greatly across sites. Further research
	is needed to determine the extent to which grassland birds are missed
	on line transects. We suggest that workers using line transects to
	study these species give careful consideration and make additional
	efforts to satisfy the distance-sampling assumption that all birds
	on or near the line are detected. If density is measured as a total
	count in a fixed area, we recommend that observers pass within <10
	m of all points in the area. ©2006 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

  abstract = {Counting techniques are widely used to study and monitor terrestrial
	birds. To assess current applications of counting techniques, we
	reviewed landbird studies published 1989-1998 in nine major journals
	and one symposium. Commonly used techniques fell into two groups:
	Procedures that used counts of bird detections as an index to abundance
	(index counts), and procedures that used empirical models of detectability
	to estimate density. Index counts rely upon assumptions concerning
	detectability that are difficult or impossible to meet in most field
	studies, but nonetheless remain the technique of choice among ornithologists;
	95% of studies we reviewed relied upon point counts, strip transects,
	or other index procedures. Detectability-based density estimates
	were rarely used and deserve wider application in landbird studies.
	Distance sampling is a comprehensive extension of earlier detectability-based
	procedures (variable-width transects, variable circular plots) and
	a viable alternative to index counts. We provide a conceptual overview
	of distance sampling, specific recommendations for applying this
	technique to studies of landbirds, and an introduction to analysis
	of distance sampling data using the program DISTANCE.},

  year = {2004},
  volume = {85},
  pages = {1591--1597},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal populations
	to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies
	is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and
	covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences.
	However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling
	abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models.
	In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates
	covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification
	of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit
	in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model
	is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance
	that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood
	estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated
	likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood
	by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect
	data of Ovenbirds \textit{(Seiurus aurocapillus)} collected using
	a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure
	(understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields
	a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative
	effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird
	density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management
	on Ovenbird populations.},

  review = {Trabalho muito interessante em que se faz uma maximização de uma verosimilhança
	que contem informação sobre a detecção e a abundância, mas eu não
	percebi bem se de facto se usa uma regressão (tipo GLM) ou uma maximização
	numérica da verosimilhança (fala-se nas duas coisas, fiquei perdido,
	e gostava de ver com o Steve).
	
	
	O modelo usado permite relacionar directamente a abundância com variaveis
	espacialmente explicitas.
	
	
	Nota que são usadas 2 variáveis e são considerados modelos Poisson
	e Binomial Negativo (4 modelos cada: um modelo sem covariaveis, um
	modelo com cada uma das duas e um modelo com as duas). O parametro
	k da binomial negativa é sempre proximo de 0, pelo que a Poisson
	é prefeirda. As variaveis estao bastante correlacionadas, oq ue explica
	que o modelo com as duas variáveis não é seleccionado, mas os modelos
	com as variaveis sozinhas são semelhantes em termos de qualidade.
	
	
	O AIC dos 4 modelos, para apoisson, varia entre 339.3 e 340.82, (1.52
	de amplitude), e os dois melhores modelos estão separados por apenas
	0.93 unidades o que é francamente pouco...
	
	
	É curioso que o valor do parâmetro da half-normal considerada é o
	mesmo, 14.23, para os 8 modelos considerados, e os autores notam
	que tal era esperado, pois de facto os N's podem ser removidos por
	condicionamento, como se faz na amostragem pod distancias tradicional.
	PERGUNTO-ME QUAL TERIA SIDO O VALOR DO PARÂMETRO SE SE TEM IGNORADO
	AS COVARIAVEIS... (seria igual?).
	
	
	Coisas a desenvolver ou criticar (STEVE):
	
	
	Não percebo como se pode obter os resultados da fig. 1 - ou melhor,
	pensei que sabia e não consigo.... (ver workspace no desktop)
	
	
	Fcio sem perceber como se consegue estimar a abundância usando este
	modelo, ou se só se obtem a relação entre abundância e covariàveis.
	Eles falam na pagina 1594 em usar BUP's para estimar os Ni's, mas
	não percebo bem como faze-lo, ou será que é simplesmente pelo preditor
	linear?
	
	
	Visto que se assume que a probabilidede de detecção é independente
	do valor das covariaveis, qual é a diferença entre fazer um glm entre
	os ni's e as covariaveis (especialmente porque apenas parecem interessados
	em estabelecer a relação entre covariaveis e abundância)????? Pois
	uma vez que se admite que a detectabilidade é constante (e como tal
	independente das covariaveis), não faz sentido inclui-la para modelar
	a relação entre covariáveis a abundância.
	
	
	Generalizar incluindo covariaveis e distancias exactas.},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {1. Monitoring red fox \textit{Vulpes vulpes} abundance is necessary
	to assess the status and management of this species and to understand
	predator-prey relationships. Spotlight counts are most often used
	for this purpose. However, comparisons between regions or over years
	may be questionable when using encounter rates, i.e. the number of
	foxes seen per kilometre. We evaluated whether distance-sampling
	methods, which take account of variation in visibility, could be
	applied to spotlight counts of foxes along roads and trails. 2. Distance-sampling
	methods were used at 12 contrasting sites in France in a systematic
	design with equally spaced transects or points. Line and point transects
	were simultaneously applied at two sites to find the more precise
	and efficient method. 3. The number of foxes seen near the centreline
	was always low, although some foxes may have been missed. A peak
	of sightings at subsequent intervals from the centreline suggested
	evasive movements. 4. Despite the low sighting frequency near the
	centreline, which may reflect a violation of distance-sampling assumptions,
	a good model fit was obtained for eight out of 12 data sets using
	a regular 50-m grouping of the distance data. Increasing the first
	interval to account for evasive movement improved model fit in the
	four other data sets. Density estimates ranged from 0.39 to 3.54
	foxes km-2 (range of coefficient of variation 4.5-24.6%). 5. Point
	and line transects resulted in similar density estimates, but point
	transects were more time consuming and resulted in larger coefficients
	of variation due to a smaller number of foxes seen by this method.
	Line transects may therefore produce better estimates of fox numbers.
	6. There were few differences among the effective strip width estimates
	between the 12 sites (range 191-286 m), thus line transect estimates
	may have a limited advantage over encounter rates. 7. Synthesis and
	applications. The systematic scheme we applied in this study improved
	sampling design and variance estimations and should be useful for
	surveying terrestrial mammals with spotlight counts. However, the
	location of transects along roads and in open habitats probably induced
	biased results. Methodological improvements are necessary before
	spotlight distance sampling can become a routine monitoring tool
	for foxes.},

	method for estimating northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) density.
	However, distance sampling using walked transects requires intense
	sampling to obtain precise estimates, thus making the technique impractical
	for large acreages. Researchers have addressed this limitation by
	either resorting to the use of indices (e.g., morning covey-call
	surveys) or incorporating the use of aerial surveys with distance
	sampling. Both approaches remain relatively untested. Our objectives
	were to 1) compare density estimates among morning covey-call surveys,
	helicopter transects, and walked transects; 2) test a critical assumption
	of distance sampling pertinent to helicopter surveys (i.e., all objects
	on line are detected); and 3) evaluate the underlying premise of
	morning covey-call surveys (i.e., that the no. of calling coveys
	correlates with bobwhite density). Our study was conducted on 3 study
	sites in Brooks County, Texas, USA, during October to December, 2001
	to 2005. Comparisons between walked transects and morning covey-call
	surveys involved the entire 5-year data set, whereas helicopter transects
	involved only the latter 2 years. Density estimates obtained from
	helicopter transects were similar to walked transect estimates for
	both years. We documented a detection probability on the helicopter
	transect line of 70 &#177; 10.2&#37; (&#37; &#177; SE; n &#61; 20
	coveys). Morning covey-call surveys yielded similar density estimates
	to walked transect estimates during only 2 of 5 years, when walked
	transect estimates were the least accurate and precise. We detected
	a positive relationship (R2 &#61; 0.51; 95&#37; CI for slope: 29.5&#8211;53.1;
	n &#61; 63 observations) between covey density and number of coveys
	heard calling. We conclude that helicopter transects appear to be
	a viable alternative to walked transects for estimating density of
	bobwhites. Morning covey-call surveys appear to be a poor method
	to estimate absolute abundance and to depict general population trajectories.},

	reproduction is food-limited, we evaluated the reproductive output

	during 1999-2002. Concurrently, we estimated densities of 10 goshawk
	prey species (seven birds, three mammals) using distance sampling.
	We then assessed the relationship between goshawk productivity (number
	of fledglings produced) and prey density within and among years by
	relating the contribution of individual prey species and total prey
	density to goshawk productivity. We also estimated the proportion
	of total diet and biomass for each species that contributed ?3% of
	all prey items. Total prey density was highly correlated with variation
	in goshawk productivity (r2 = 0.98, P = 0.012). Red squirrel (Tamiasciurus
	hudsonicus) density explained more variation in goshawk productivity
	than any other species (r2 = 0.94, P = 0.031), but density could
	not be estimated for every predominant prey species in goshawk diets.
	However, only red squirrels had a positive and significant relationship
	to goshawk productivity in terms of frequency (r2 = 0.97, P = 0.014)
	and biomass (r2 = 0.95, P = 0.033). Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus)
	and cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), which contributed the greatest
	frequency and biomass, respectively, to goshawk diets, showed no
	relationship with goshawk productivity. Even though goshawks on the
	Kaibab Plateau have a diverse diet and will readily switch to alternate
	prey species, goshawk productivity showed significant interannual
	variation. Our results suggest that the magnitude of goshawk productivity
	was determined by total prey density and annual variation was driven
	by differences in the densities of critical prey species. © 2005

  abstract = {Although considerable effort has been made to identify the appropriate
	climatic conditions for bird surveys, considered as standard conditions,
	in many occasions these conditions are not fulfilled. These are for
	instance the case of environmental impact assessments (EIA), where
	the field work is, recurrently, carried out in variable and non-standard
	weather conditions or in the scope of general ecological monitoring
	(GEM) programs, where different taxa (birds and other animal groups)
	are sampled simultaneously with distinct methodological requirements.
	The present work examined the applicability of a stochastic dynamic
	methodology (StDM) for predicting the richness and diversity of passerine
	surveys in mountain habitats characterized by variable and, predominantly,
	non-standard weather conditions. The relative variations of these
	metrics are the underlying database of our StDM model, providing
	some basis to analyse the accuracy of bird surveys. This model focuses
	on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components,
	such as the passerine richness and diversity, and the influence of
	the prevailing climatic conditions. The proposed model was preceded
	by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to
	discriminate the significant relationships between the selected metrics
	versus climatic variables. Since this statistical analysis is static,
	the dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of weather
	conditions (ranging from standard to extreme conditions). The results
	of the StDM simulations revealed significant variations in the performance
	of passerine surveys in response to several combinations of non-standard
	weather conditions, which enable us to calculate the appropriated
	correction factors for discrete climatic scenarios. This could be
	used, in the future, to improve the quality of passerine diversity
	and richness estimates, namely in the scope of EIA studies when the
	climatic conditions are inevitably adverse for rigorous passerine
	surveys.},

	 thoughts exchanged with Eric below
	
	
	 Hi Eric,
	
	
	 Some comments...
	
	
	 Why is their obscure way of calculating densities based on home ranges
	truth? Were did they get the different bits of data used in that
	procedure?
	
	
	 But more relevant perhaps, the problems that they present for line
	transects (a separate section in the intro: "the line transect technique
	for orangutan nests and its problems) are exactly the same for plot
	sampling. In fact, under what scenario would you not be able to see
	all the nests on the line, but then would be able to see all the
	nests in entire plots? That's just nonsense, unless you want to make
	it so, but then it should take much more time to completely check
	the plots than do the line transect.
	
	
	 I wonder if there might be an issue of avoidance of nest building
	near the transect, as this was along a "recently established... narrow
	boardwalk" - this alone would lead to underestimation I guess - though
	it would have to be a weird combination of things to make it so that
	the combined data set was better. The truth is that the key bit of
	information missing is the number of nests say in the first 3 meters
	that were missed, to see if this was a g(0) issue or not. If it was,
	then MRDS would be ideal for this, with the second pass providing
	the recaptures - and plot sampling should not really help...
	
	
	 The key idea, of DS being biased if g(0)<1 is a fair point. The entire
	example just seems useless...},

  abstract = {<p>Cuvierâ€™s beaked whales (<italic>Ziphius cavirostris</italic>)
	are known as extreme divers, though behavioral data from this difficult-to-study
	species have been limited. They are also the species most often stranded
	in association with Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar use, a relationship
	that remains poorly understood. We used satellite-linked tags to
	record the diving behavior and locations of eight <italic>Ziphius</italic>
	off the Southern California coast for periods up to three months.
	The effort resulted in 3732 hr of dive data with associated regional
	movements â€“ the first dataset of its kind for any beaked whale
	â€“ and included dives to 2992 m depth and lasting 137.5 min, both
	new mammalian dive records. Deep dives had a group mean depth of
	1401 m (s.d.â€Š=â€Š137.8, nâ€Š=â€Š1142) and duration of 67.4 min
	(s.d.â€Š=â€Š6.9). The group mean time between deep dives was 102.3
	min (s.d.â€Š=â€Š30.8, nâ€Š=â€Š783). While the previously described
	stereotypic pattern of deep and shallow dives was apparent, there
	was considerable inter- and intra-individual variability in most
	parameters. There was significant diel behavioral variation, including
	increased time near the surface and decreased shallow diving at night.
	However, maximum depth and the proportion of time spent on deep dives
	(presumed foraging), varied little from day to night. Surprisingly,
	tagged whales were present within an MFA sonar training range for
	38% of days locations were received, and though comprehensive records
	of sonar use during tag deployments were not available, we discuss
	the effects frequent acoustic disturbance may have had on the observed
	behaviors. These data better characterize the true behavioral range
	of this species, and suggest caution should be exercised when drawing
	conclusions about behavior using short-term datasets.</p>},

	part of reintroductions, providing a basis for management intervention
	designed to achieve long-term persistence. The Arabian oryx \textit{Oryx
	leucoryx} became extinct in the wild in 1972, surviving as captive
	populations. Since 1982 reintroductions of Arabian oryx have taken
	place in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Modelling of oryx population dynamics
	has highlighted the importance of precise estimation of population
	size (N). Between 1990 and 2000 three methods of estimating N have
	been applied in Mahazat as-Sayd protected area in Saudi Arabia: derived
	population estimates (DPE) based on known births and deaths, distance
	sampling, and mark-resighting (MR). This study assesses the feasibility
	and precision of these methods. Inability to assess precision, interdependence
	of consecutive estimates, and the assumption that all gains and losses
	are recorded, make DPE of limited value. At current densities, distance
	sampling along 455 km of driven transects yields too few detections
	to derive precise estimates of N. To achieve a coefficient of variation
	of 20% it would be necessary to drive up to c. 2,900 km of transect;
	this amount of survey effort could be achieved through pooling of
	data across repeat surveys of established transects. MR estimates,
	based on re-sighting of collared oryx, have the potential to yield
	the most precise estimates of N when the proportion of marked animals
	reaches 30% of the total population. The most reliable MR estimates
	available indicate the Mahazat as-Sayd Arabian oryx population had
	grown to >400 animals by 2000. © 2003 FFI.},

	and southern Kenya. Here, we describe its status and habitat in the
	Wembere Steppe, Sukumaland, Tanzania, an unprotected area of seasonally
	inundated grassland bordered partly by Acacia scrub. Although its
	habitat in the steppe was thought likely to span c. 175 km north-south
	during the 1960s to 1970s, we found the apalis to be patchily distributed
	over a distance of only 102 km north-south. Distance sampling yielded
	a density estimate of c. 7-16 birds km-2; equivalent to c. 3-7 pairs
	km-2, after juveniles (18% of the population) were excluded, and
	assuming that all adults were paired. The species occupied a very
	narrow foraging niche, feeding almost exclusively in Whistling Thorn
	\textit{Acacia drepanolobium}, which accounted for 66% of woody stems
	in the study area, but for 95% of stems in the immediate vicinity
	of apalis sightings. Half of all individuals were encountered in
	the tallest, densest stands of A. drepanolobium, which covered less
	than 6% of the study area. Signs of scrub clearance, pruning and
	browsing were widespread in the steppe, and may have intensified
	during 1967-2002, when the human population in surrounding districts
	increased at a mean rate of c. 2-4% per year. Further research is
	required to determine whether our findings are representative of

	the impact of which on its birds is difficult to gauge in the absence
	of quantitative information on their habitat use and abundance. During
	October 1999, habitat associations of nine restricted-range species
	and of 12 species with which they were commonly associated, were
	measured at Ruhija, Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Logistic regression
	analysis was used to determine the relationship between habitat,
	topography, altitude and species occurrence. Population densities
	of 19 species were estimated using distance sampling, at survey points
	visited between dawn and midday. Although the detection rate declined
	during the morning, observations made towards midday helped to improve
	precision, without lowering density estimates. Eight habitat and
	topographical features significantly associated with restricted-range
	species are described. Few of the features measured were significantly
	associated with more than one species, underlining the importance
	of maintaining a diverse forest structure. Two restricted-range species
	were among the commonest birds in the study area, while a further
	four species were at least as abundant as their more widespread congeners.},

  abstract = {To provide sustainable income from forestlands, large areas in the
	tropics are planted with "agricultural" trees, such as oil palm and
	rubber, and "industrial" trees, such as Acacia mangium and Gmelina
	arborea. To examine how native forest birds use such plantations,
	we surveyed in 2005 the avifauna at Sabah Softwoods, a plantation
	in southeastern Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We focused on A. mangium,
	Albizia (Paraserianthes falcataria), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis),
	and logged native forest, and compared our results to those of a
	study conducted at the same plantation in 1982. The number of forest
	species in the industrial groves did not change dramatically between
	1982 and 2005, even though the trees had been cropped several times
	and the plantation was, by 2005, completely surrounded by cleared
	land and far removed from primary forest. However, as is common in
	logged or isolated forests throughout the world, certain primary
	forest groups (e.g., muscicapine flycatchers) have been extirpated
	from the entire plantation area. The industrial groves also lacked
	some larger species of kingfisher, woodpeckers, and canopy frugivores.
	Nevertheless, numerous primary forest taxa (ca. 50% of species) were
	found in mature industrial tree groves. Albizia attracted the most
	species of birds, followed closely by Acacia. Both tree types underpinned
	relatively complex secondary forests that attracted forest birds.
	In contrast, younger groves of Acacia and Albizia held mainly open
	country and scrub species. Oil palm, as a remarkably simple and unusual
	habitat, attracted few bird species. Sustained occurrence of forest
	birds in all groves of exotic trees at Sabah Softwoods was substantially
	enhanced by the relatively rich avifauna of the logged native forest
	remaining in substantial stands throughout the plantation.},

  abstract = {We compared breeding bird communities and vegetation characteristics
	at paired point locations in primary (undisturbed) and mature secondary
	forest (70-100 years old) sites in Great Smoky Mountains National
	Park, USA to understand how sites logged prior to creation of the
	park compare to undisturbed sites following 70 years of protection
	from human disturbance. We found that bird and vegetation communities
	are currently similar, but retain some differences in species composition.
	Rank abundance curves for primary and secondary forest bird communities
	showed very similar patterns of species dominance. Species composition
	was also similar on the two sites which shared 24 of the 25 most
	frequently recorded species. Nonetheless, comparisons of density
	estimates derived from distance sampling showed three bird species
	were more abundant on primary forest sites and that one bird species
	was significantly more abundant on secondary forest sites. Notably,
	comparisons based on raw counts (unadjusted for potential differences
	in detectability) produced somewhat different results. Analyses of
	vegetation samples for the paired sites also showed relative similarity,
	but with some differences between primary and secondary forests.
	Primary forest sites had more large trees (trees greater than 50
	cm diameter at breast height) and late successional species. Primary
	forest sites had a denser tall shrub layer while secondary forest
	sites had a denser canopy layer. Nonetheless, tree species richness,
	basal area of live trees and number of standing snags did not differ
	between primary and secondary forest sites. Results indicate that
	breeding bird communities on sites within the park that were logged
	commercially 70 years ago are currently quite similar to bird communities
	on sites with no history of human disturbance. Similarities between
	the bird communities on previously disturbed and undisturbed sites
	in Great Smoky Mountains National Park may exceed those on more fragmented
	landscapes because large patches of primary forest, adjacent to commercially
	logged sites, remained in the park when it was established in 1935.
	These patches of primary forest may have served as source areas for
	commercially logged sites.},

	because wind power generation is rapidly expanding
	
	worldwide. A mortality estimate is based on the number of fatalities
	assumed caused by wind turbines and found during periodic searches,
	plus
	
	the estimated number not found. The 2 most commonly used estimators
	adjust mortality estimates by rates of searcher detection and scavenger
	
	removal of carcasses. However, searcher detection trials can be biased
	by the species used in the trial, the number volitionally placed
	for a given
	
	fatality search, and the disposition of the carcass on the ground.
	Scavenger removal trials can be biased by the metric representing
	removal rate,
	
	the number of carcasses placed at once, the duration of the trial,
	species used, whether carcasses were frozen, whether carcasses included
	injuries
	
	consistent with wind turbine collisions, season, distance from the

  year = {2004},
  volume = {34},
  pages = {99--114},
  number = {1-2},
  abstract = {1. The need to assess population size and change is central to any
	population monitoring programme. A range of monitoring techniques
	is available for deer, but few studies have addressed the performance
	of these techniques in terms of their accuracy and their power to
	detect population changes reliably. This study compares the performance
	of three commonly used techniques to monitor woodland deer populations
	in terms of their accuracy, precision and statistical power using
	field data and simulation modelling. 2. Faecal Standing Crop (FSC)
	was found to provide the most accurate estimates at all deer densities
	studied, but was outperformed by distance sampling using thermal
	imaging in terms of precision and statistical power. Faecal Accumulation
	Rate (FAR) performed worst in terms of precision and statistical
	power, and was inferior in terms of accuracy to FSC. The accuracy
	of FAR and distance sampling using thermal imaging was similar. 3.
	Annual surveying is not the best use of resources, since 10% per
	annum increases or decreases in a population could not be detected
	by any of the techniques within a 3-year time period. Even with the
	best technique under the most favourable conditions of deer density
	simulated in this study, a population change could only be detected
	reliably once the population had increased by 33% or decreased by
	27%. In the least favourable conditions, the respective figures were
	a 380% increase or extinction. 4. All the techniques studied are
	relatively poor at detecting population change, so their use in practical
	deer management needs to be treated with caution. The consequences
	of relying on similar techniques to detect population change for
	rare species could be severe. © 2004 Mammal Society, Mammal Review.},

  abstract = {The underwater television (UWTV) technique for Nephrops stock assessment
	was evaluated from 7 grounds in the Aegean. Expert analysts made
	all burrow identification and burrow size measurements. Burrow density
	was given by (1) real-time in situ counts; (2) post-sampling laboratory
	replicate counts; and (3) multiple laboratory counts in strips analyzed
	by DISTANCE sampling in order to account for partial burrows and
	edge effects leading to over- or underestimation of densities. Trawls
	were used to estimate densities, mean carapace length and weight
	per ground. The laboratory method was the most efficient approach.
	In situ counts resulted in underestimation at high densities and
	overestimation at low densities. Further work with DISTANCE should
	include simulations with hypothetical data to optimise band widths
	related to the expected burrow size. All burrow density estimates
	produced similar significant negative relationships with burrow size
	and positive relationships with trawl density. Based on the tow length
	effects analysis, the use of tow lengths of 500 and 1000 m per station
	for high and mid-/low-density sites, respectively, is recommended.
	With expert analysts, laboratory counts, trawl support data, accurate
	delimitation of the grounds and adequate sampling spread to allow
	for local stock variability differences, the UWTV technique can be
	used for fishery-independent stock assessments, and its precision
	refined by taking into account edge effects.},

	Changes in agricultural practices during the past 50 years have been

	conservation practices encouraged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
	National Conservation Buffer Initiative meet many of the needs of
	sustainable agriculture and offer excellent opportunities to enhance
	local grassland bird populations within intensive agricultural production
	systems. Despite the abundant information on avian use of and reproductive
	success in, strip habitats during the breeding season, few studies
	have examined the potential value of field borders for wintering
	birds. We planted 89.0 km of field borders (6.1 m wide) along agricultural
	field edges on one-half of each of three row crop and forage production
	farms in northeastern Mississippi. We sampled bird communities along
	these field edges during February-March 2002 and 2003 using line-transect
	distance sampling and strip transects to estimate density and community
	structure, respectively. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate densities
	of Song (Melospiza melodia), Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis),
	and other sparrows along bordered and non-bordered transects while
	controlling for adjacent plant community. Greater densities of several
	sparrow species were observed along most bordered transects. However,
	effects of field borders differed by species and adjacent plant community
	types. Diversity, species richness, and relative conservation value
	(a weighted index derived by multiplying species-specific abundances
	by their respective Partners in Flight conservation priority scores)
	were similar between bordered and non-bordered edges. Field borders
	are practical conservation tools that can be used to accrue multiple
	environmental benefits and enhance wintering farmland bird populations.
	Provision of wintering habitat at southern latitudes may influence
	population trajectories of short-distance migrants of regional conservation

	walk behaviour, with previous visitation increasing or decreasing
	the probability of repetition. (iii) LÃ©vy movement involves a step-length

	distributions, and adaptive in exploring new environments or searching
	for rare targets. Each of these modelling arenas implies more detail
	in the movement pattern than general models of movement can accommodate,

  abstract = {We combined Breeding Bird Survey point count protocol and distance
	sampling to survey spring migrant and breeding birds in Vicksburg
	National Military Park on 33 days between March and June of 2003
	and 2004. For 26 of 106 detected species, we used program DISTANCE
	to estimate detection probabilities and densities from 660 3-min
	point counts in which detections were recorded within four distance
	annuli. For most species, estimates of detection probability, and
	thereby density estimates, were improved through incorporation of
	the proportion of forest cover at point count locations as a covariate.
	Our results suggest Breeding Bird Surveys would benefit from the
	use of distance sampling and a quantitative characterization of habitat
	at point count locations. During spring migration, we estimated that
	the most common migrant species accounted for a population of 5000-9000
	birds in Vicksburg National Military Park (636 ha). Species with
	average populations of >300 individuals during migration were: Blue-gray
	Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum),
	White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea),
	and Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula). Of 56 species that
	bred in Vicksburg National Military Park, we estimated that the most
	common 18 species accounted for >8150 individuals. The six most abundant
	breeding species, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, White-eyed Vireo, Summer
	Tanager (Piranga rubra), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis),
	Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), and Brown-headed Cowbird
	(Molothrus ater), accounted for >5800 individuals. © The Cooper Ornithological

  abstract = {Distance sight-resight sampling has particular relevance to aerial
	surveys, in which height above ground and aircraft speed make the
	critical assumption of certain detection on the track-line unrealistic.
	Recent developments in distance sight-resight theory have left practical
	issues related to data collection as the major impediment to widespread
	use of distance sight-resight sampling in aerial surveys. We describe
	and evaluate a system to automatically log, store, and process data
	from distance sight-resight aerial surveys. The system has a primary
	digital system and a secondary audio system. The digital system comprises
	a sighting "gun" and small keypad for each observer, a global positioning
	system (GPS) receiver, and an altimeter interface, all linked to
	a central laptop computer. The gun is used to record time and angle
	of declination from the horizon of sighted groups of animals as they
	pass the aircraft. The keypad is used to record information on species
	and group size. The altimeter interface records altitude from the
	aircraft's radar altimeter, and the GPS receiver provides location
	data at user-definable intervals. We wrote software to import data
	into a database and convert it into a form appropriate for distance
	sight-resight analyses. Perpendicular distance of sighted groups
	of animals from the flight path is calculated from altitude and angle
	of declination. Time, angle of declination, species, and group size
	of sightings by independent observers on the same side of the aircraft
	are used as criteria to classify single and duplicate sightings,
	allowing testing of the critical distance sampling assumption [g(0)=1]
	and estimation of g(0) if that assumption fails. An audio system
	comprising headphones for each observer and a 4-track tape recorder
	allows recording of data that are difficult to accommodate in the
	digital system and provides a backup to the digital system. We evaluated
	the system by conducting experimental surveys and reviewing results
	from actual surveys.},

	four types of line-transect estimator (simple parametric, generalised

	data from macropod populations of known density. Bias was stable
	across all grouping levels tested for the simple parametric estimator,
	and stable across all but the coarsest grouping level for the generalized
	parametric and non-parametric estimators, but varied substantially
	across the range of levels tested for the quasi-strip estimator.
	Precision improved as the number of grouping levels increased for
	all estimators tested, but the extent of improvement varied between
	estimators, and for the estimator most affected, improvement was
	marginal beyond intermediate grouping levels. Density estimates were
	generally more accurate and precise when analysed in ungrouped form
	than in grouped form. Varying the analytical unit did not affect
	bias, but precision was significantly lower for cluster analysis
	than individual analysis for all estimators.},

	is essential in many areas of ecological research, management, and
	policy-making. Because common methods for modeling and estimating
	abundance (e.g., capture-recapture, distance sampling) are sometimes
	not practical for large areas or elusive species, indices are sometimes
	used as surrogate measures of abundance. We present an extension
	of the Royle and Nichols (2003) generalization of the MacKenzie et
	al. (2002) site-occupancy model that incorporates length of the sampling
	interval into the model for detection probability. As a result, we
	obtain a modeling framework that shows how useful information can
	be extracted from a class of index methods we call indirect detection
	indices (IDIs). Examples of IDIs include scent station, tracking
	tube, snow track, tracking plate, and hair snare surveys. Our model
	is maximum likelihood, and it can be used to estimate site occupancy
	and model factors influencing patterns of occupancy and abundance
	in space. Under certain circumstances, it can also be used to estimate
	abundance. We evaluated model properties using Monte Carlo simulations
	and illustrate the method with tracking tube and scent station data.
	We believe this model will be a useful tool for determining factors
	that influence animal distribution and abundance.},

  abstract = {Recreational hunting is the primary management tool used by natural
	resource agencies to control ungulate populations. Although free-ranging
	ungulates have been studied extensively in North America, relatively
	little is known about the field behavior of hunters or the factors
	that influence hunting behavior, except on small study areas where
	access is limited and controlled. We developed 3 integrated protocols
	to estimate hunter density, distribution, movements, habitat use,
	characteristics, and attitudes, which can be used on large areas
	with unrestricted access. We described how aerial surveys, in conjunction
	with distance sampling techniques and a Geographic Information System
	(GIS) database of landscape characteristics, provide estimates of
	hunter density and a map of hunter distribution and habitat use.
	We used Global Positioning System (GPS) units issued to hunters to
	systematically record hunter locations. Hunters also completed a
	simple questionnaire. We linked these data and used them to obtain
	detailed information on habitat use, movements, and activity patterns.
	Whereas aerial surveys are limited to discrete points in time and
	relate only to aggregations of hunters, data collected on hunters
	that carry GPS units can be used to study habitat use and distribution
	at different times of day for individual hunters. Finally, linked
	responses from a traditional mail or telephone survey to hunter location
	data collected via GPS units to assess how hunter characteristics
	(e.g., age, physical condition, attitudes) were related to field
	behavior. We applied these techniques during a white-tailed deer
	(Odocoileus virginianus) hunting season on a large tract (45,749
	ha) of public land in Pennsylvania, USA, with unrestricted hunter
	access. We estimated density of 7 hunters/1,000 ha (95% CI: 4.2 to
	10.3) in the morning and 6.3 hunters/1,000 ha (95% CI: 3.5 to 10.0)
	in the afternoon. We found that hunter density was negatively related
	to distance from roads and slope. Most hunters preferred stand hunting,
	especially in the early morning hours (0600-0800 hr; 72% stationary);
	more walked or stalked in the afternoon (1400-1600 hr; 58% stationary).
	The average maximum distance hunters reached from a road open to
	public vehicles was 0.84 km (SE = 0.03), and they walked an average
	of 5.48 km (SE = 0.193) during their daily hunting activities. We
	believe that the approaches we used for studying hunter behavior
	will be useful for understanding the connections between hunter attitudes
	and behavior and hence will allow managers to predict hunter response
	to changes in harvest regulations. Furthermore, our methods are more
	accurate than requesting hunters to self-report where they hunted.
	For example, we found that hunters reported that they walked >2.5
	times farther from the nearest road (x? = 2.23 km, SE = 0.13) than
	actual distance recorded via GPS units (x? = 0.84 km, SE = 0.03).
	Our research provides wildlife managers with new knowledge on several
	levels. At the most basic level, we learned a great deal about what
	hunters actually do while in the field, rather than simply what they
	report. Second, linking field behavior with hunter characteristics
	will provide insights into the likely effects of changing hunter
	demographics. Finally, linking these data with traditional human-dimensions
	research topics, such as attitudes toward hunting regulations, may
	allow managers to better forecast the potential effects of regulation
	changes on hunter distribution and effort.},

	to an increase in human settlement and livestock densities. The effect
	of these factors on BMNP's wildlife is assessed and discussed. Most
	large mammalian wildlife has declined since 1983 but signs of recovery
	for some species in recent years are positive. The fates of two charismatic
	endemics are emphasised. BMNP's current population of mountain nyala
	(\textit{Tragelaphus buxtoni}, an endangered antelope) was estimated
	to be between 1100 and 1300. This is lower than estimates for the

	declines between 1989 and 1992 due to rabies epizootics. Action to

  year = {2007},
  abstract = {{This paper describes an algorithm for the automatic detection of
	a particular class of underwater sounds, using a single hydrophone.
	It is observed that many life-forms, systems or mechanisms emit distinctive
	acoustic signatures which are characterized by packets of relatively
	high frequency sound that are repeated at regular, low frequency
	intervals. These types of sounds are commonly produced by biological
	(e.g. fishes and invertebrates) and anthropogenic (e.g. scuba diver)
	sources. The algorithm exploits a simple feature, extracted from
	the raw hydrophone signal, which enables robust detection even in
	conditions of severe background noise. In order to demonstrate how
	the algorithm can be used, trial applications are presented for the
	detection of two different kinds of underwater sound source. First,
	the algorithm is applied to the problem of detecting soniferous fish
	sounds, showing that it is possible to robustly automate the detection
	of instances of cusk-eel presence in hydrophone recordings, thereby
	simplifying the arduous task of human monitoring of long sound recordings
	in marine biological research. Second, the algorithm is applied to
	the problem of automatic diver detection in a noisy urban estuary,
	demonstrating its potential for harbor security and fleet protection.}},

  abstract = {<p>An increasing number of studies employ spatial capture-recapture
	models to estimate population size, but there has been limited research
	on how different spatial sampling designs and trap configurations
	influence parameter estimators. Spatial capture-recapture models
	provide an advantage over non-spatial models by explicitly accounting
	for heterogeneous detection probabilities among individuals that
	arise due to the spatial organization of individuals relative to
	sampling devices. We simulated black bear (<italic>Ursus americanus)</italic>
	populations and spatial capture-recapture data to evaluate the influence
	of trap configuration and trap spacing on estimates of population
	size and a spatial scale parameter, sigma, that relates to home range
	size. We varied detection probability and home range size, and considered
	three trap configurations common to large-mammal mark-recapture studies:
	regular spacing, clustered, and a temporal sequence of different
	cluster configurations (i.e., trap relocation). We explored trap
	spacing and number of traps per cluster by varying the number of
	traps. The clustered arrangement performed well when detection rates
	were low, and provides for easier field implementation than the sequential
	trap arrangement. However, performance differences between trap configurations
	diminished as home range size increased. Our simulations suggest
	it is important to consider trap spacing relative to home range sizes,
	with traps ideally spaced no more than twice the spatial scale parameter.
	While spatial capture-recapture models can accommodate different
	sampling designs and still estimate parameters with accuracy and
	precision, our simulations demonstrate that aspects of sampling design,
	namely trap configuration and spacing, must consider study area size,
	ranges of individual movement, and home range sizes in the study
	population.</p>},

  abstract = {We used line transects and distance sampling in combination with radiotelemetry
	to estimate density of a desert tortoise \textit{(Gopherus agassizii)}
	population in the Rincon Mountains near Tucson, Arizona, USA, as
	part of a long-term study evaluating the impact of urban development
	on tortoises. During 2000, 34 1-km transects were each sampled twice
	in the 368.5-ha study area. We observed 46 tortoises with midline
	carapace lengths ?150 mm (subadults and adults) plus 7 juveniles
	on transects. For subadults and adults, the encounter rate was 0.63
	tortoises/km, and the mean proportion of tortoises observable during
	radiotelemetry, conducted concurrently with transect sampling, was
	82%. Corrected mean density based on line transects and radiotelemetry
	was 0.523 tortoises/ha (CV = 22.99, 95% CI = 0.29-0.79), and absolute
	abundance in the study area was estimated to be 193 (CV = 23.0%,
	CI = 107-291). Using the 2 independent coverages of transects as
	separate samples, the Lincoln-Petersen mark-recapture estimator produced
	an abundance estimate of 224 subadult and adult tortoises (CV = 53.9%,
	CI = 72-440). Transects measured on the ground over uneven topography
	resulted in 3% smaller estimates of density when compared to analysis
	with transect lengths determined from coordinates plotted on a map.
	Distance sampling appears to be a feasible method of estimating density
	of Sonoran Desert populations of the desert tortoise, but transect
	lengths should be based on mapped rather than measured distances
	to prevent biases caused by uneven topography.},

  abstract = {Detailed information on year-round distribution, seasonal abundance
	and inter-annual trends of a given species is essential for any conservation
	effort. However, for most odontocetes this knowledge is rather limited.
	Therefore, area-specific management or conservation plans are often
	difficult to argue for. This is also true for the harbour porpoise
	(Phocoena phocoena), although it is the most common cetacean species
	in the North Sea. Knowledge of the current status of local stocks
	as well as fine scale information on the temporal use of certain
	areas by the species is incomplete. One area of concern is the southern
	North Sea where the abundance of harbour porpoises has declined in
	the twentieth century. Recent studies using stranding data and observations
	from seabird surveys indicate a comeback of the species along the
	Dutch and Belgian coast. However, data on other regions of the southern
	North Sea is sparse. Between 2002 and 2004, we undertook 25 aerial
	line transect surveys (11,000 km on effort; altitude = 250 and 600
	ft) in a 2,500 km2 coastal area off Eastern Frisia, Germany including
	a small portion of Dutch coastal waters. The data were g(0) corrected
	using a double platform approach and analysed with distance sampling
	software. A total of 426 harbour porpoises were sighted, including
	eight calves. Densities ranged between <0.1 and 1.62 individuals/km2
	with peaks in February and July 2003 as well as February and May
	2004. The results of our study show that harbour porpoises are present
	in the coastal part of the southern North Sea even during their reproductive
	period. However, they seem to appear in lower numbers and much more
	irregular than in other areas, for example off Northern Frisia. The
	results of this study support the recent findings that despite a
	decline in the mid-twentieth century, harbour porpoises are now at
	times quite abundant in the southern North Sea. The underlying factors
	of this 'return' should be investigated using a combination of surveys
	and satellite telemetry. © Springer-Verlag and AWI 2006.},

  abstract = {The subdesert mesite, a terrestrial non-passerine bird endemic to
	the Mikea Forest of southwest Madagascar, is currently classified
	as globally threatened (category: Vulnerable). However, accurate
	assessment of threat in accordance with the IUCN Red List criteria
	(A, B and C) requires data on effective population size, area of
	habitat occupied and rate of decline, none of which is available
	for this species. Here we present the first empirical estimates of
	its population size using five complementary methods, three incorporating
	data on territory size and two using data gathered during call-playback
	surveys conducted throughout its entire global range. Estimates vary
	from 98,000 to 152,000 individuals, with the most reliable possibly
	being that generated by distance sampling (115,000). This figure
	is more than an order of magnitude greater than the only published
	estimate of <10,000 individuals. By analysing data on forest cover
	change, we estimate the population of the subdesert mesite to have
	declined by, at most, 10% in three generations. Although the rate
	of deforestation in 1994-1999 is double that calculated for 1962-1994,
	it is deemed unlikely that the population will decline by 20% over
	the next three generations. As such the species fails to meet criterion
	A. Although the subdesert mesite's range and area of occupancy are
	small, they are not fragmented and do not comprise fewer than 10
	locations. Consequently, this species does not meet criterion B.
	Further, the species fails to meet criterion C, for which a maximum
	of 10,000 mature adults is required. According to IUCN (2000 Red
	List of Threatened Species) this species should therefore be downlisted
	in status. We discuss why it still warrants conservation attention
	and suggest the need for modifications to the criteria thresholds
	in relation to basic information about the ecology and taxonomic
	distinctness of species. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

	were conducted on roads from vehicles and also on foot along 26 parallel

	Pantanal, Brazil. Deer densities were estimated using the program
	DISTANCE, and the program MONITOR was used to run a power analysis

	The deer density estimated from vehicles, with data from both years,
	was 9.81±3.8 individual/km2, and 5.53±0.68 individuals/km2 from transects
	sampled on foot. The power analysis of these data revealed a monitoring
	program would require at least two surveys per year over seven years

	very high frequency, spread spectrum), integration of GPS with other

  abstract = {Animal tracking is a growing field in ecology and previous work has
	shown that simple speed filtering of tracking data is not sufficient
	and that improvement of tracking location estimates are possible.
	To date, this has required methods that are complicated and often
	time-consuming (state-space models), resulting in limited application
	of this technique and the potential for analysis errors due to poor
	understanding of the fundamental framework behind the approach. We
	describe and test an alternative and intuitive approach consisting
	of bootstrapping random walks biased by forward particles. The model
	uses recorded data accuracy estimates, and can assimilate other sources
	of data such as sea-surface temperature, bathymetry and/or physical
	boundaries. We tested our model using ARGOS and geolocation tracks
	of elephant seals that also carried GPS tags in addition to PTTs,
	enabling true validation. Among pinnipeds, elephant seals are extreme
	divers that spend little time at the surface, which considerably
	impact the quality of both ARGOS and light-based geolocation tracks.
	Despite such low overall quality tracks, our model provided location
	estimates within 4.0, 5.5 and 12.0 km of true location 50% of the
	time, and within 9, 10.5 and 20.0 km 90% of the time, for above,
	equal or below average elephant seal ARGOS track qualities, respectively.
	With geolocation data, 50% of errors were less than 104.8 km (&lt;0.94Â°),
	and 90% were less than 199.8 km (&lt;1.80Â°). Larger errors were
	due to lack of sea-surface temperature gradients. In addition we
	show that our model is flexible enough to solve the obstacle avoidance
	problem by assimilating high resolution coastline data. This reduced
	the number of invalid on-land location by almost an order of magnitude.
	The method is intuitive, flexible and efficient, promising extensive
	utilization in future research.},

	cattle ranch in a coastal savannah in Tanzania, now included in the
	new Saadani National Park. Data were analysed with DISTANCE sampling
	and conventional strip transect techniques and were compared with
	results of previous wildlife counts. Few individuals of mainly browsing
	species were present in former cattle grazing areas exhibiting high
	bush-encroachment while a ten times higher biomass of browsers and
	grazers was found in the cattle-unmodified savannah. Population sizes
	of some species increased twofold between 1991 and 2001 within the
	entire area but neither population size nor species richness increased
	in the abandoned rangeland during our 3-year study period from 2001
	to 2003. We conclude that the former ranch has potential for future
	recolonization by wild ungulates. Resettlement will take place gradually
	with 'pioneer-species' facilitating the entry of more demanding species.
	Habitat restoration through wildlife can be observed and quantified
	on Mkwaja Ranch which will be of importance for future management

  abstract = {Sound-and-orientation recording tags (DTAGs) were used to study 10
	beaked whales of two poorly known species, Ziphius cavirostris (Zc)
	and Mesoplodon densirostris (Md). Acoustic behaviour in the deep
	foraging dives performed by both species (Zc: 28 dives by seven individuals;
	Md: 16 dives by three individuals) shows that they hunt by echolocation
	in deep water between 222 and 1885 m, attempting to capture about
	30 prey/dive. This food source is so deep that the average foraging
	dives were deeper (Zc: 1070 m; Md: 835 m) and longer (Zc: 58 min;
	Md: 47 min) than reported for any other air-breathing species. A
	series of shallower dives, containing no indications of foraging,
	followed most deep foraging dives. The average interval between deep
	foraging dives was 63 min for Zc and 92 min for Md. This long an
	interval may be required for beaked whales to recover from an oxygen
	debt accrued in the deep foraging dives, which last about twice the
	estimated aerobic dive limit. Recent reports of gas emboli in beaked
	whales stranded during naval sonar exercises have led to the hypothesis
	that their deep-diving may make them especially vulnerable to decompression.
	Using current models of breath-hold diving, we infer that their natural
	diving behaviour is inconsistent with known problems of acute nitrogen
	supersaturation and embolism. If the assumptions of these models
	are correct for beaked whales, then possible decompression problems
	are more likely to result from an abnormal behavioural response to
	sonar.},

  abstract = {Caribbean hurricanes often impact terrestrial vertebrates in forested
	environments. On 21 September 1998, Hurricane Georges impacted Puerto
	Rico with sustained winds in excess of 166 km/hr, causing damage
	to forests of the island's principal mountain range; the Cordillera
	Central. We estimated forest frog abundance and diversity from call
	counts conducted along marked transects before and after Hurricane
	Georges in two forests reserves of the Cordillera Central (Maricao
	and Guilarte). We used distance sampling to estimate density of Eleutherodactylus
	coqui and recorded counts of other species. After the hurricane,
	the abundance of E. coqui increased in both reserves compared to
	prehurricane levels while abundance of other frog species decreased.
	In Maricao, relative abundance of E. richmondi (P = 0.013) and E.
	brittoni (P = 0.034) were significantly lower after the hurricane.
	Moreover, species richness and evenness of the Maricao and Guilarte
	frog assemblages declined after the hurricane. Our results on abundance
	patterns of the forest frog assemblages of Maricao and Guilarte Forests
	were similar to those reported from the Luquillo Experimental Forest
	after Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. Long-term demographic patterns
	of the forest frog assemblages in the Cordillera Central may be associated
	with changes due to the ecological succession in post-hurricane forests.

  abstract = {Encounters with North Pacific right whales have been rare after illegal
	catches by the USSR in the 1960s. Since the discovery of a few whales
	on the Bering Sea shelf in 1996, NOAA surveys conducted from 1997
	to 2008 have encountered small numbers of right whales there and
	have collected identification photographs and biopsy samples (photographs
	of one whale just south of the Aleutian Islands were also collected).
	Twenty-one individuals were identified by microsatellite genotyping,
	and 22 individuals were identified from oblique and aerial photographs.
	We estimated abundance of right whales using mark-recapture analysis
	applied to both datasets. The POPAN formulation of the Jolly-Seber
	open model was used, investigating all combinations of constant and
	time-dependent capture probability, survival, and probability of
	entry. For the genetic dataset, sexspecific models were also investigated.
	The best model in each case (as chosen by AICc) was a constant parameter
	model, which was unsurprising given the small sample sizes. The photo-identification
	estimate was 38 (95% CI 28-63); the second-best model (with time-dependent
	capture probability) gave nearly identical results. The genetic estimate
	of total abundance was 25 (95% CI 22-45), with 7 females (95% CI
	6-17) and 18 males (95% CI 16- 33). Models with time or sex-specific
	capture probability gave similar results. These represent the first
	abundance estimates for the eastern North Pacific population, although
	we emphasize that they may represent a sub-population showing strong
	site fidelity to the southeastern Bering Sea. Although extensive
	whaling also occurred in the Gulf of Alaska, only two individuals
	have been identified from that region, and neither has been seen
	in the Bering Sea. These results confirm the eastern North Pacific
	right whale is one of the most endangered whales in the world; the
	extremely low number of females in the population makes long-term
	persistence of this population precarious.},

	photographic = 31 (95% CL 23â€“54), genotyping = 28 (95% CL 24â€“42).
	We also estimated the population contains eight females (95% CL 7â€“18)
	and 20 males (95% CL 17â€“37). Although these estimates may relate
	to a Bering Sea subpopulation, other data suggest that the total
	eastern North Pacific population is unlikely to be much larger. Its
	precarious status todayâ€”the world's smallest whale population for
	which an abundance estimate existsâ€”is a direct consequence of uncontrolled
	and illegal whaling, and highlights the past failure of international
	management to prevent such abuses.},

	of wildlife protection areas. Wild and domestic mammals >0.2Â kg
	were sampled by distance technique. Small mammals <0.2Â kg were trapped
	and a vegetation survey was performed. Livestock and some medium-sized
	wildlife species were most abundant in livestock areas, while large-sized
	wildlife species were mainly restricted to wildlife areas. Most red-listed
	species were confined to the national park. The influence of land
	use on abundances changed moderately between seasons. However, cattle
	moved into wildlife areas during the wet season. Differences in species
	richness and diversity were most pronounced during the dry season.
	The trapping frequency of small mammals was highest in the national
	park. Differences in vegetation structure included sparser field
	layer and higher cover of an invasive shrub in livestock areas. Our
	study shows the importance of protected areas for many wildlife species
	in the Kalahari. It also shows the value of a multi-species approach
	for investigating the effects of land use on wildlife communities.},

  year = {2003},
  volume = {31},
  pages = {1138--1149},
  abstract = {Estimates of the size or density of wildlife populations are essential
	for effective management. Aerial surveys often are the only practical
	way of obtaining these estimates for large mammals ranging over a
	large area. Different aerial survey techniques are available. This
	paper reports on a study that estimated abundance and population
	density of wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Australian Alps using
	helicopter aerial surveys. Three frequently used techniques were
	compared simultaneously: strip counts, mark-recapture, and line transect.
	Using data on horse groups over a strip width of 200 m, estimates
	of horse abundance from mark-recapture analyses were higher (N=3,045
	modified Petersen and N=3,298 Huggins estimators, respectively) than
	from strip counts (N=1,814 and N=2,242 for observers 1 and 2, respectively).
	Use of line-transect analysis yielded the highest estimates of abundance
	(N=5,200-5,830, population density D=1.86-2.09 ${\rm km}^{-2}$).
	The coefficient of variation (CV) of estimates varied from 22% for
	strip counts (0-50 m) to 28% for mark-recapture analysis (0-50 m)
	and 31-32% for line-transect analysis (0-200 m). Mark-recapture estimates
	of horse abundance from the modified Petersen estimator were substantially
	lower when the strip width was 200 m (N=2,061) compared with a strip
	width of 50 m (N=4,345). These results suggested that in aerial surveys
	using strip or mark-recapture analyses, the effect of wide strip
	width should be examined; otherwise estimates may be strongly negatively
	biased. Observer 1 estimated mean group size of 4.91+-0.61 SE horses
	and observer 2 estimated mean group size as 3.79+-0.57 SE horses.
	Mean group size observed from the ground was 5.65+-0.51 SE. We recommend
	that aerial surveys be implemented periodically using line-transect
	methodology to monitor trends in wild horse abundance in the Australian
	Alps.},

  year = {2009},

  pages = {78--84},
  abstract = {<P></P>Because tiger <I>Panthera tigris</I> numbers are regulated
	by their prey base, prey abundance needs to monitored and estimated
	reliably. Recently, distance sampling has been adopted as the most
	appropriate method and is now becoming the standard monitoring protocol
	in all tiger range countries in south Asia. However, the accuracy
	of the density estimates generated by this method has not been assessed.
	From total counts within habitat blocks, we obtained accurate density
	estimates of ungulates within three main habitats in Bardia National
	Park, Nepal. We then applied the distance sampling method in the
	same habitats and compared the results. Distance sampling on foot
	in dense habitats (riverine forest and tallgrass floodplain) violated
	method assumptions, and sampling from vehicle along roads gave biased
	estimates. Sampling from elephant back worked well in all habitat
	types, but owing to their behaviour, the density of barking deer
	<I>Muntiacus muntjak</I> was underestimated. The accuracy of the
	estimates varied with sampling effort; for the very abundant chital
	deer <I>Axis axis</I>, estimates varied markedly at &#60;200 animal
	observations, but converged at larger sample sizes to a similar point
	estimate as intensive block counts when approaching 300 observations.
	For the less abundant species, with &#60;20 observations along &#62;100&#8201;km
	of transect lines, the confidence intervals were quite high, and,
	hence, of limited value for detecting short-term populations trends.
	It is therefore difficult to obtain accurate density estimates of
	rare species by the distance method. In areas consisting of dense
	habitats, we recommend that the food base of tiger be estimated by
	distance sampling from elephant back, not on foot, directed at the
	main and most abundant prey species. For rare species, encounter
	rates obtained simultaneously may then serve as indices of relative
	abundances.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to estimate the level of mortality of North Island
	tomtits \textit{(Petroica macrocephala toitoi)} during an aerial
	1080 possum poisoning operation in Tongariro Forest, New Zealand,
	and to evaluate transect-based alternatives to banding for monitoring
	tomtit populations. The operation used 12 g toxic (1080 at 0.15%
	weight/weight) cereal baits sown at 3 kg/ha. Transects were established
	at three neighbouring sites; two within the 1080 poison area, and
	one outside. The re-sighting of l4 out of 15 banded male tomtits
	at one site within the 1080 operation indicated that mortality was
	low. This was backed up by results from a before-after-control-impact
	(BACI) design to analyse density estimates from distance sampling
	along transects. We analysed the change in counts of territorial
	males before and after the operation based on the same transect surveys.
	This also showed little impact of poisoning on tomtits, and indicated
	that loss rates greater than 8.4% due to 1080 were incompatible with
	the data (95% one-sided confidence bound). Counts of territorial
	males gave a much tighter confidence bound than the banding or distance
	sampling results. Of the techniques applied, the counting of territorial
	males appears to have the most promise for providing high-precision
	estimates of short-term impacts, by taking full advantage of the
	territorial habits of male tomtits in spring. However, distance sampling
	shows potential for providing the basis for longer-term monitoring
	of tomtit populations. The transect-based approaches involved substantially
	fewer resources than banding for estimating short-term impacts, and
	offer a considerably less-intensive means of longer-term monitoring
	of tomtits.},

  abstract = {One of the most pervasive uses of indices of wildlife populations
	is unconnected counts of animals. Two examples are the minimum number
	known alive from capture and release studies, and aerial surveys
	where the detection probability is not estimated from a sightability
	model, marked animals, or distance sampling. Both the mark-recapture
	and distance-sampling estimators are techniques to estimate the probability
	of detection of an individual animal (or cluster of animals), which
	is then used to correct a count of animals. However, often the number
	of animals in a survey is inadequate to compute an estimate of the
	detection probability and hence correct the count. Modern methods
	allow sophisticated modelling to estimate the detection probability,
	including incorporating covariates to provide additional information
	about the detection probability. Examples from both distance and
	mark-recapture sampling are presented to demonstrate the approach.

	As examples, the suggestion for interpolating is weird. I would much
	rather imagine that one could create a model as a function of covariates
	which would then be used to predict density from, so a model based
	rather than an ad hoc smoothing estimate.
	
	
	The concept seems to work, and it removes the bias of initial tag
	location by getting inferences from the relative proportions in each
	area. So essentially you can get higher variances in areas where
	you have less tracks, nbut not necessarily bias. This is obviously
	a big advantage over just "track density", which is obviosly biased

  abstract = {Effective wildlife conservation strategies require an understanding
	of how fluctuating environmental conditions affect sensitive life
	stages. As part of a long-term study, we examined post-fledging and
	post-independence survival of 89 radio-marked juvenile Northern Goshawks
	(Accipiter gentilis) produced from 48 nests in northern Arizona,
	USA, during 1998-2001. Information-theoretic methods were used to
	examine within- and among-year variation in survival relative to
	environmental (prey abundance, weather), territory (hatching date,
	brood size), and individual (gender, body mass) sources of variation.
	The results support age- and cohort-specific differences in survival
	that were best explained by behaviors occurring at distinct stages
	of juvenile development, annual changes in the density of primary
	bird and mammal prey species, and gender-related differences in body
	mass. Survival between fledging and independence increased linearly
	with age and varied among annual cohorts of radio-marked juveniles
	from 0.81 (95% CI 5 0.60-0.93) to 1.00 (95% CI 5 0.95-1.00) in association
	with annual differences in prey density; the slope coefficient for
	the additive effect of prey density on survival was 1.12 (95% CI
	5 0.06-2.19). Survival declined to 0.71 (95% CI 5 0.60-0.93) shortly
	after juveniles initiated dispersal (weeks 8-12 post-fledging) and
	moved to more open habitats at lower elevations. Survival was not
	closely associated with weather or territory-level parameters. A
	comparison of the predictions of environmental-, territory-, and
	individual-based models of survival demonstrated that food availability
	was the primary factor limiting juvenile survival. This finding indicates
	that forest management prescriptions designed to support abundant
	prey populations while providing forest structural conditions that
	allow goshawks to access their prey within breeding areas should
	benefit juvenile survival. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	technique of distance sampling, flushed birds were counted along
	line transects walked in stratified random blocks of forest within
	the species' range. The same transects were surveyed as used in the
	1992-94 survey, enabling direct comparison of the results. Densities
	were estimated using the DISTANCE program, combining these data with
	those from a similar survey of Capercaillie in 1992-94 to allow a
	more robust estimate of the detection function. Results: The Capercaillie
	population was estimated to be 1073 birds (95% CL 549-2041). This
	represents a decline of 51% between the two surveys, at a rate of
	13% per annum. Females declined at a faster rate than males resulting
	in a marked change in the sex-ratio, which was close to 1:1 for the

	in both native pinewoods and other woodlands in comparison to 1992-94.
	Even so, densities were significantly higher in native pinewoods
	(1.63 km-2) than in other woodlands (0.43 km-2), which comprised
	largely planted Scots Pine \textit{Pinus sylvestris}, larch \textit{Larix
	spp.}, Lodgepole Pine \textit{Pinus contorta} and Sitka Spruce \textit{Picea
	sitchensis}. Overall, Capercaillie tended to use forest stands with
	a high proportion of Scots Pine and Blaeberry Vaccinium myrtilus;
	features that are typical of native pinewoods and old pine plantations.
	Conclusions: The Capercaillie population has undergone a dramatic
	decline during the last five years. The decline has been greater
	for females and has occurred across habitats. This information is
	helping to focus efforts in securing the future for Capercaillie
	in Scotland, which has now become a major conservation challenge.},

  volume = {11},
  pages = {--},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Information on animal abundance and distribution is at the cornerstone
	of many wildlife and conservation strategies. However, these data
	can be difficult and costly to obtain for cetacean species. The expense
	of sufficient ship time to conduct design-unbiased line transect
	surveys may be simply out of reach for researchers in many countries,
	which nonetheless grapple with problems of conservation of endangered
	species, by-catch of small cetaceans in commercial fisheries, and
	progression toward ecosystem-based fisheries management. Recently
	developed spatial modeling techniques show promise for estimating
	wildlife abundance using non-randomized surveys, but have yet to
	receive much field-testing in areas where designed surveys have also
	been conducted. Effort and sightings data were collected along 9
	650 km of transects aboard ships of opportunity in the Southern Ocean
	during the austral summers of 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Generalized
	additive models with generalized cross-validation were used to express
	heterogeneity of cetacean sightings as functions of spatial covariates.
	Models were used to map predicted densities and to estimate abundance
	of humpback, minke, and fin whales in the Drake Passage and along
	the Antarctic Peninsula. All species' distribution maps showed strong
	density gradients, which were robust to jackknife resampling when
	each of 14 trips was removed sequentially with replacement. Looped
	animations of model predictions of whale density illustrate uncertainty
	in distribution estimates in a way that is informative to non-scientists.
	The best abundance estimate for humpback whales was 1 829 (95% CI:
	978-3 422). Abundance of fin whales was 4 487 (95% CI: 1 326-15 179)
	and minke whales was 1,544 (95% CI: 1,221-1,953). These estimates
	agreed roughly with those reported from a designed survey conducted
	in the region during the previous austral summer. These estimates
	assumed that all animals on the trackline were detected, but preliminary
	results suggest that any negative bias due to violation of this assumption
	was likely small. Similarly, current methodological limitations prohibit
	inclusion of all known sources of uncertainty in the favored variance
	estimator. Meanwhile, our approach can be seen generally as an inexpensive
	pilot study to identify areas of predicted high density that could
	be targeted to: inform stratified designs for future line transect
	surveys, making them less expensive and more precise; increase efficiency
	of future photo-identification or biopsy studies; identify candidate
	time-area fisheries closures to minimize by-catch; or direct ecotourism
	activities. The techniques are likely to apply to areas where funding
	is limiting, where cetacean studies or wilderness-based tourism are
	just beginning, or in regions where even a very rough estimate of
	animal abundance is needed for conservation or management purposes.

	Second, we identified occupied habitat using observations from a

	a study of breeding biology from 2000-2002. Third, we estimated breeding
	densities within a framework designed specifically for distance sampling.
	We mapped 82750 ha of potential habitat. We recorded 2516 plover
	locations from which we estimated 29 176 ha of occupied habitat.
	We estimated densities for 14 960 ha of potential habitat. Average
	plover density from 2000-2002 was 7.9 ± 0.9 (SE) breeding adults
	km-2, a high value compared with other sites. We calculated a population
	of 1187 ± 140 (SE) plovers in the distance sampling area. Assuming
	density in our sampling area was similar for all documented occupied
	habitat, we estimated the population of plovers in South Park at
	2310 adults. We conclude that South Park represents a contemporarily
	large concentration of breeding Mountain Plovers.},

	The Vulnerable St Lucia whiptail lizard \textit{Cnemidophorus vanzoi},
	considered a single species, is the sole representative of its genus
	in the Caribbean region, found on Maria Major and Maria Minor islands
	off the coast of St Lucia. However, a recent study revealed significant
	morphological and phylogenetic differences between the two populations

	We surveyed the two populations and estimated them to comprise 1,985
	and 29 individuals on Maria Major and Minor, respectively. The Maria
	Minor population is currently at a critically low level and consequently
	highly susceptible to demographic and genetic stochasticity and catastrophic
	events, in particular the colonization of invasive mammalian predators.
	If our goal is to conserve biodiversity and evolutionary potential
	we face a dilemma in formulating the optimum strategy for the management
	of these two threatened populations on the species boundary. We discuss
	some potential management options but also raise this issue for discussion

	but current distribution, population sizes and trends are poorly
	known. Line transect surveys were conducted in coastal waters of
	the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the summer of 2001-2003.
	Abundances of three species were estimated by conventional and multiple
	covariate distance sampling (MCDS) methods. Time series of abundance
	estimates were used to derive rates of increase for fin whales (\textit{Balaenoptera
	physalus}) and humpback whales (\textit{Megaptera novaeangliae}).
	Fin whales occurred primarily from the Kenai Peninsula to the Shumagin
	Islands, but were abundant only near the Semidi Islands and Kodiak.
	Humpback whales were found from the Kenai Peninsula to Umnak Island
	and were more abundant near Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands and north
	of Unimak Pass. Minke whales (\textit{B. acutorostrata}) occurred
	primarily in the Aleutian Islands, with a few sightings south of
	the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. Humpback whales were
	observed in large numbers in their former whaling grounds. In contrast,
	high densities of fin whales were not observed around the eastern
	Aleutian Islands, where whaling occurred. Average abundance estimates
	(95% CI) for fin, humpback and minke whales were 1652 (1142-2389),
	2644 (1899-3680), and 1233 (656-2315), respectively. Annual rates
	of increase were estimated at 4.8% (95% CI=4.1-5.4%) for fin and
	6.6% (5.2-8.6%) for humpback whales. This study provides the first
	estimate of the rate of increase of fin whales in the North Pacific
	Ocean. The estimated trends are consistent with those of other recovering
	baleen whales. There were no sightings of blue or North Pacific right
	whales, indicating the continued depleted status of these species.},

  review = {In this paper we report estimates of the source characteristics of
	Ziphius echolocation clicks using the novel approach of two tagged
	whales recording each other. We provide the first estimates of the
	source level, directivity index, and spectral properties of Ziphius
	clicks, which are shown to differ significantly from those produced
	by non-ziphiid toothed whales described so far, suggesting a strong
	potential for passive acoustic monitoring.
	
	
	Clicks from each tagged whale were automatically detected and verified
	by visual inspection of temporal and spectral characteristics, to
	establish the time of click emission and the interclick interval
	~ICI! statistics. The position of the tags on the dorsal surface
	of the whale, behind the sound source, leads to a poor estimate of
	the spectrum of the click in the forward direction. For this reason,
	the tag recordings were examined for clicks from other whales with
	ICI and spectral characteristics consistent with far-field Ziphius
	clicks.
	
	
	The result was a set of far-field Ziphius click wave forms with unknown
	source aspect. Many of these clicks occurredin short sequences of
	increasing and then decreasing amplitude, presumably due to movement
	of the clicking whale with respect to the receiver as the whale scanned
	with a directional sonar beam. Assuming that Ziphius, like all other
	odontoceti investigated, concentrate sound energy into a forward-directed
	beam, the highest amplitude clicks were considered to best represent
	the click wave form within the beam ~Møhl et al., 2000; Johnson et
	al., 2004!. These clicks were reserved for spectral analysis.
	
	
	
	
	The authors have observed significant head movements in another beaked
	whale species, Mesoplodon densirostris, while clicking, supporting
	the notion that this is also likely the case in Ziphius.
	
	
	A potential problem with using tags to measure the SL of clicks from
	conspecifics is that whales may avoid ensonifying each other with
	high-powered clicks as has been suggested for spinner dolphins (Brownlee
	and Norris, 1994). Thus, the maximum of 214 dBpp re: 1 mPa at 1 m
	may simply be the result of the whales reducing the volume when ensonifying
	each other.
	
	
	In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Ziphius produce ultrasonic
	echolocation clicks with center frequencies around 42 kHz and the
	distinctive form of a FM up-sweep. The derived directivity index
	of 30 dB is a little higher than predictions based on other toothed
	whales, but may be a slight overestimation. The maximum SL of 214
	dBpp re: 1 mPa at 1 m is probably an underestimate. The clicks have
	a longer duration than clicks from other non-ziphiid toothed whales.
	The estimated energy flux density of 164 dB re: 1 mPa2 s is comparable
	to that of clicks from bottlenose dolphins, which have considerably
	higher peak-to-peak sound pressures. It is thus evident that Ziphius
	produce clicks with temporal and spectral properties that differ
	from those of clicks produced by most other toothed whales, and that
	the clicks, on that basis, hold a potential for acoustic classification
	and passive monitoring.},
