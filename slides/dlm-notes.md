In case I forget about these things:

  * `plot.gam`
    * `scale=` is IMPORTANT, also the aspect of the picture can influence your inference.
  * `vis.gam`
    * misleading due to median of other covariate values being taken to produce the plot


# R/RStudio stuff

  * [R for cats](http://rforcats.net/) is a good introduction to R
  * RStudio project files
    - Make a "project" per project
    * Keep all files in that folder
    * Number your files if they have an order
  * Clearing your session in RStudio
    * `Session > Clear Workspace...`
  * What is RMarkdown?
    * chunks vs text
    * options (just figure dimensions and captions?)
    * HTML vs PDF (vs Word!)?
  * Executing chunks from Rmd files
  * Tab/auto-completion/help
