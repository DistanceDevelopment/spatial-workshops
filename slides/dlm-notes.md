In case I forget about these things:

* `plot.gam`
  * `scale=` is IMPORTANT, also the aspect of the picture can influence your inference.
* `vis.gam`
  * misleading due to median of other covariate values being taken to produce the plot
* truncation
  * get folks to play with this a bit, but don't let them get distracted
  * NB can't select using AIC!


# R/RStudio cheatsheet

* [R for cats](http://rforcats.net/) is a good introduction to R
* RStudio cheatsheets
* RStudio project files
  - Make a "project" per project
  * Keep all files in that folder
  * Number your files if they have an order
* Clearing your session in RStudio
  * `Session > Clear Workspace...`
* What is RMarkdown?
  * chunks vs text
  * options (just figure dimensions and captions?)
  * HTML vs PDF (vs Word!)?
* Executing chunks from Rmd files
