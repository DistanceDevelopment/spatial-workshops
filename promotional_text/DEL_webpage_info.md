# Course title

**Spatial models for distance sampling data using R and ArcGIS**

# Audience

The course is intended for quantitatively-minded scientists who wish to analyse spatially explicit line transect distance sampling data. In particular we envisage graduate students/postdocs/faculty in applied ecology, government/industry scientists and wildlife managers amongst the participants. Although the main examples in the course will be in a marine setting, the methodology and software demonstrated are equally applicable to terrestrial situations.


# Program Description


*Exact schedule may be subject to change, please see [the course site](http://distancesampling.org/workshops/duke-spatial-2015) for up-to-date information.*

The workshop will cover both theory and practice and demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for spatial modelling of distance sampling data collected via line transect surveys.

Throughout the course we will follow the "density surface modelling" approach of [Hedley and Buckland (2004)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.4271&rep=rep1&type=pdf), updated with methods from [Miller et al (2014)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12105/pdf) -- that is first modelling detectability via a detection function, then using this to create a detection-adjusted spatial model using generalized additive models (GAMs). Modelling will take place in R using packages developed by the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling and NOAA.

An integral part of developing these models is the management and manipulation of geospatial data. Important skills include mapping and exploring data, reformatting data for analysis, obtaining and sampling environmental predictors (e.g. from remote sensing imagery), and moving data between GIS and R. For these activities, we will use ArcGIS and the Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET) package ([Roberts et al. 2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815210000885)), developed at the Duke Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab.


## Day 1

  * Introduction to distance sampling
  * Fitting and understanding detection functions
  * Model selection and criticism for detection functions
  * Abundance estimation via Horvitz-Thompson estimators


## Day 2

  * What is a GAM?
  * How do DSMs work?
  * Manipulating line transect data in ArcGIS
  * Obtaining and sampling environmental data
  * Exchanging data between ArcGIS and R
  * Performing exploratory analyses


## Day 3

  * Fitting simple DSMs
  * Which environmental predictors should I include in my model?
  * Fitting DSMs with many predictors
  * DSM model selection

## Day 4

  * Abundance estimation using DSMs
  * Variance estimation for DSMs

## Note

Practical lessons will be taught in a computer lab at Duke, however participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops and use them for some or all parts of the practical sessions. Those bringing their own laptops should consult materials [on the course website](http://distancesampling.org/workshops/duke-spatial-2015) to ensure that their software is setup correctly beforehand.
