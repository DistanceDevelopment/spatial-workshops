# Green

* Ease of instruction. Helpful advice when encountering issues
* really easy to follow -- clear explanations, not overwhelming
* Good pace, I like that we're not getting caught up in model building etc
* very well organised and good level.

# Red

* Everything was good
* Setup/logistics are always hard at the beginning. Maybe a little slow on the setup.
* ? maybe fewer words/slide (e.g. don't need full sentences)
* timing, did we cover all we meant to
