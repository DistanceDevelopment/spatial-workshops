author: David L Miller

# Green

* Good presentation of information. Good explanations and advice
* reading outloud the results and going through your thought process was *extremely* useful
* nice explanation of model selection
* organisation very logical and well thought out. Overall very good
* Good discussion about EDF vs. AIC vs. REML vs. D^2. We're all looking for rules of thumb, it was great hearing your thoughts about this and how it sometimes comes down to personal preference

# Red

* Would bve good to have more time for this lecture and to perhaps do a thought exercise as a group or in small groups?
* Including "screenshots" from the R console could help better understand some parts of the presentation. (like the ones from the model summaries, they help a lot)
* Would like more info on REML calculation. What about ecological reasons for keeping variables in models?
* I don't understand how to do model diagnostic with vis.gam(model) results.
