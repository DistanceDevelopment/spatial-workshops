# Green

* Good overview of all the components of the course i.e. DSM flow diagram (it helps put all the puzzle pieces together)
* Great job explaining complex topics. Bonus for differentiating between additive and bivariate. This answered many of my GAM questions.
* Overall, it was a good session. You covered GAMs in a very logical way (i.e. braking them down)

# Red

* The count distribution part of the presentation could have been more clear. e.g. outlining all the classes before going into "Tweedie distribution"
* An introduction to GAMs would have been useful.
