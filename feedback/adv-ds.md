# Green

* Two thumbs up for getting into the maths. Particularly enjoyed the sources of uncertainty. Looking fwd to abundance.
* Liked simplistic explanation instead of pure mathematical explanations
* Please talk about on friday: rounding of perp. dist. what to do about this? [picture of heaped distances]
* He's making sure that any unanswered questions will be addressed later on in the course
* Nice job fielding tough questions and explaining concepts in an understandable way! Chalk-drawn examples were helpful.
* Knowledge of material, background into, application to marine data
* nice to see things in R



# Red

* more details on adjustment terms in lecture 1 or this lecture would be good. Maybe more R examples (e.g. in R)
* include a flow diagram @ beginning to better explain steps. Include ref papers/readings @ end of slides. Include meaning of symbol in formula in slide, even if mentioned in previous presentation b/c new and still trying to learn
* would be good to have the slides on print outs for notes etc
* Hard to see white text on light pink background
* it would be useful to go over all the stats/calculus concepts which will be covered throughout the class/lab at the beginning of the session
* do more highlighting w/in formulas highlighting what each variable means
