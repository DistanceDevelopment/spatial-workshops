# Green

* The most concise summary of distance sampling I have ever seen, also great animations!
* Thanks for the R code for the slides. That's great
* Very good an easy to follow presentation
* Clear, clear slideshow very helpful and easy to follow
* good overview to get my mind working
* All very clear, David. The lecture was very good. Like the animation
* Understanding details of what exactly scale and shape parameters referred to
* Good explanations and introduction
* Regularly made sure that everyone was on the same page. He included both terrestrial and marin examples. Used the same data in examples as the data that would be used in the lab
* Great explanation of the 2 models hazard and half! Looking forward to doing distance in R. I have only use the Windows version



# Red

* Slow down!
* He could have made references to specific scientific papers/studies
* Get that screen to work :)
* A little to much flipping back and forth between slides
* Still curious about transferring into point surveys (but understand this is not relevant to the example)
* Seemed to jump around a little and not fully explain some points
* A slow down during formulas and talking about effective strip width
