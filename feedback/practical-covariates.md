# Green

* So happy the data was all ready downloaded. Nice talk through of the models
* V. helpful highlights of MGET :)
* Good introduction to some of the MGET tools. Good references to marine/terrestrial systems (i.e. keeping the terrestrial people in mind)

# Red

* Explain where people can learn more MGET? Is there an easy way to search MGET tools within ArcCatalog/ArcMap etc? (i.e. search "HDF" didn't bring up tools?)
* would have been nice to show the ESRI tool for gettting values from rasters for points
* would use more time for this lecture/lab. Would be good to have us try to build our own model to get a certain product
* It would have been good to discuss the implications of collecting data from a point in time (i.e. June to August) and only fitting June SST/chloro... data to the model
