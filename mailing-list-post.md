title: Mailing list course description for "Spatial modelling of distance sampling data"
author: David L Miller & Jason J Roberts

On **[DATES (course)]** Duke Environmental Leadership programme in collaboration with the University of St Andrews will run a course on spatial modelling methods for distance sampling line transect data.

The course will cover the basics of organising survey data in ArcGIS (using the MGET toolbox developed at the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, Duke) and then analysing this data in R using (using packages developed at the Centre for Reasearch into Ecological and Environmental Modelling, St Andrews). The aim will be to show participants an end-to-end workflow for spatial modelling, and illustrate the underlying methodology behind both spatial modelling and distance sampling (in particular the "density surface modelling" approach).

The course is intended for graduate students/postdocs/faculty in applied ecology, government/industry scientists and wildlife managers interested in developing spatially explicit models of abundance. Prior knowledge of R and ArcGIS will be highly advantageous, as is a quantitative background.

The course will be taught by David L Miller (St Andrews) and Jason J Roberts (Duke), at the Duke campus in Durham, NC.

The deadline for registration is **[DATE (registration)]**.
