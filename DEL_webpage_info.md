# Course title

Some options:

 * Spatially explicit models for distance sampling data
 * Spatial models for distance sampling data
 * Spatial modelling of line transect data
 * Species distribution modelling for distance sampling data


# Audience

The course is intended for quantitatively-minded scientists who wish to analyse spatially explicit line transect distance sampling data. In particular we envisage graduate students/postdocs/faculty in applied ecology, government/industry scientists and wildlife managers amongst the participants. Although the main examples in the course will be in a marine setting, the methodology and software demonstrated is equally applicable to terrestrial situations.


# Program Description


*Exact schedule may be subject to change, please see [the course site](github pages URL) for up-to-date information.*

The workshop aims to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for spatial modelling of distance sampling data collected via line transect surveys.

Throughout the course we will follow the "density surface modelling" approach of [Hedley and Buckalnd (2004)[URL], updated with methods from [Miller et al (2014)](URL) -- that is first modelling detectability via a detection function, then using this to create a detection-adjusted spatial model using generalized additive models (GAMs). Modelling will take place in R using packages developed by the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling and NOAA.

An integral part of developing these spatially explicit models is the management and collection of data. Participants will also be shown how to use ArcGIS (and the MGET toolbox) to correctly format their data once it's been collected and easily augment it with spatial data available from online databases. Most data manipulation and exploratory analysis will happen in Arc, using tools in the MGET package, developed at the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab.


## Day 1

  * Introduction to distance sampling
  * Fitting and understanding detection functions
  * Model selection and criticism for detection functions
  * Abundance estimation via Horvitz-Thompson estimators


## Day 2

  * What is a GAM?
  * How do DSMs work?
  * Introduction to spatial data in Arc
  * Performing exploratory analyses
  * Fitting simple DSMs


## Day 3

  * Which environmental predictors should I include in my model?
  * Fitting DSMs with many predictors
  * DSM model selection

## Day 4

  * Abundance estimation using DSMs
  * Variance estimation for DSMs
  * Advanced DSM topics




## Note

Practical lessons will be taught in a computer lab at Duke, however participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops and use them for some or all parts of the practical sessions. Those bringing their own laptops should consult materials [on the course website](github pages URL) to ensure that their software is setup correctly beforehand.
