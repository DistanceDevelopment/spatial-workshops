# Practical exercises & solutions

Here you can find the exercises and solutions for the practical sessions during the course. All content is here and will remain here on the Distance website for future consultation.

## Practicals

Practicals are provided in [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) (`.Rmd`) format. RMarkdown can be opened in RStudio and the file "knitted" into HTML or PDF.

An HTML version of all practicals is provided [here](practicals/bookdown/) and is generated using using the [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/) package.

Note that the practicals are designed to be run sequentially, files generated from previous analyses are loaded and used in subsequent analyses.

## Data

To run the sperm whale analysis you'll need to download the following files, unzip them and store the unzipped folders in the same place as the `Rmd` files below:

- [Analysis.gdb](practicals/Analysis.gdb.zip)
- [Covariates_for_Study_Area.zip](practicals/Covariates_for_Study_Area.zip)

We'd like to thank Jason Roberts of Duke University for preparing these files in ArcGIS with the [MGET Toolbox](http://mgel2011-kvm.env.duke.edu/mget/).

## Problems

If you run into a problem running any of these examples, please report [an issue on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/spatial-workshops/issues). Or contact the workshop instructors.
