# Intentions

* Do you intend to conduct a distance sampling survey in the future? (radio, y/n)
* Do you intend to analyse previously collected data? (radio, y/n)
* What is the source of the previously collected data? (check box)
  * University collection
  * Private company
  - State government

  * Other


# Equipment

It is not necessary to bring your own computer. We will conduct the practical sections of the workshop in a computer lab that will have all necessary software installed. But if you bring your own computer, are interested and sufficiently skilled, and have the necessary software installed, we welcome you to run the practical exercises on your computer instead, or use it to experiment with your own data. Portions of the workshop will use ArcGIS Desktop, which is not free and only runs on Microsoft Windows. All statistical analysis will be done in R, which is free and runs on may platforms.

* Do you want to run the practical exercises on your own laptop? (Answering yes does not mean you will not have a computer lab machine. Everyone will have a lab machine, regardless of whether they're also using a laptop.) (radio buttons, yes/no)
* What operating system does it have? (radio buttons)
  * Mac
  * Windows
  * Linux
* Will it have the following installed? (check box)
  * R
  * RStudio
  * Packages
  * ArcGIS
  * MGET
