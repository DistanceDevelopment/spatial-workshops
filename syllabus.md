title: 'Syllabus for "Spatial modelling of distance sampling data"'
author: David L Miller

# Abstract

This document defines the syllabus for the *"Spatial modelling of distance sampling data"* course. I've attempted to separate the lectures into "chunks" that are 45 minutes long, followed by a practical that takes up a similar amount of time (I think it's important that we leave plenty of time to explore the data, get comfortable with Arc/R and so on).


## Notes

  * Perhaps worth having the confirmed participants go through a questionnaire beforehand to see what the level of the audience is.
  * Data set names (in monospace font after reference) relate to data that is freely available and shipped with R packages.
  * Have folks log into mozpad to post questions and answer questionnaires anonymously.

NB when scheduling: (from Laura)

  * The ICL has a class in it on Tuesday/Thursday, from 1:20-2:40 pm,that cannot be moved. Could you please schedule a topic for these times that would not require computing?
  * Due to another Tuesday/Thursday class that begins at 4:40 pm, weâ€™re being requested to end by 4:30 pm on those days (in computer room).

# Distance sampling topics

## Introduction to distance sampling/detection functions

  * Line transect sampling
    - General sampling setup
    - Exact distances vs. grouped/binned distances
    * Assumptions
  * Detection functions
    - What are the options?
    * What do they look like?
  * Fitting detection functions
    - Brief R examples
    - Explanation of general syntax
    * Interpreting `summary`

### Practical: fitting detection functions in R

  * Investigating the data, basic EDA in R
  * Fitting a detection functions
  * Interpreting `summary` results
  * Some setup for covariate models (plot group size etc against $\hat{p}$)

## Evaluating detection functions

  * Model checking/selection
    * Goodness-of-fit
    * AIC
    * Detection function criteria
      * Assumptions
      * Convergence
  * Variance estimation
    * Where does uncertainty come from? (Conceptually)
    * Effects of survey design

### Practical: model checking in R

  * Finding the AIC, GoF test results
  * Q-Q plotting


## Further detection function modelling

  * Adding covariates
    * When should we include covariates?
    * Possible covariates (what data to collect)
    * Group size issues
  * What are detection functions good for?
    - Estimating probability of detection
    - Simple Horvitz-Thompson ideas -- in the limit, many strata leads to DSM

### Practical: Covariates and abundance

  * Fitting covariate models
    * Model checking from above, revisited
  * Abundance estimation
    * Stratification
    * Variance estimation



# Spatial modelling


## What is density surface modelling?

  * Survey/data setup
    - What is a segment?
    - Useful conventions for data management
    - Offsets
  * Count as response
    - Calculation of offset
    - Model formulation
  * Estimated abundance as response
    * Calculation of response/offset
    * Model formulation
  * Relative merits of each approach
    * Segment-level observation covariates


## Introduction to Generalized Additive Models

  * What is a GAM?
  * Smoothers
    - Penalties and bases
    * What do they look like?
    * Uni- vs. multivariate smoothers
  * Response distributions
    - Count distributions zoo
  * How do we fit GAMs?
    - Linear model vs. interpolation (what is a smoothing parameter?)
    * Basis complexity and relation to penalty
    - 5 minute guide to GCV/REML (conceptual)
  * Model checking/discrimination/criticism
    - Q-Q plots
    - Residuals
    - AIC/deviance/$R^2$/REML score/GCV score




### Practical: First look at GAMs

  * Syntax-maths/concepts translation
  * Simple (perhaps non-distance sampling) examples
    * 1D smooths
    * 2D smooths
  * Emphasis on plotting smooths, looking at model checking plots
  * Getting data into R
  * Fitting basic models with just spatial covariates
  * Model checking as covered above


## Day-to-day use of DSM

  * Using environmental covariates
    * Appropriate bases for particular measurements
    * Extra shrinkage/penalty ideas
  * Response distributions
    * Using Tweedie and negative binomial distributions
  * Model selection
    * Follow up on deviance/AIC/REML score ideas

### Practical: Practical use of DSM

  * Fitting many models with different covariates
  * Looking at check plot output
  * Which summaries to look at -- selection criteria


## What can I do with my fitted DSM?

  * Prediction
    * What are predictions? (Scale and temporal relevance)
    * Predictions over a grid vs for an area
    * Offsets
  * Variance estimation of predictions
    * Where does uncertainty come from?
    * Per cell vs. overall uncertainty
  * Presenting predictions and their uncertainties

### Practical: Using DSM objects

  * Using `predict`
    * Making prediction grid
    * Plotting predictions
    * "Overall" (whole study area) abundance
  * Variance estimation
    * Plotting uncertainty (with effort)
    * Overall uncertainty


## Advanced topics in density surface modelling

*This list is very rough, may depend on what participants are interested in. At this point these are possible topics not a definitive programme.*

*One option is to review the landscape of what's going on and offer only a couple of slides on each with references so people know where to go.*

  * Spatial autocorrelation
    * Checking
    * Strategies for accounting for it
  * Strange shaped study areas
    * soap film smoothing
  * Variance estimation via parametric bootstrap
    * Bayesian interpretation of the GAM
  * $g(0)$ problems
    * "Perception bias" -- double observer methods, mark-recapture distance sampling
    * "Availability bias" -- fixed correction, hidden Markov models etc
  * Combining surveys
    * Different platforms at similar times
    * Geographical/temporal "patching" (Jason)
  * Temporal trends
    * Movement/displacement
  * Zero-inflated models
    * New `mgcv`, usable only with count models
